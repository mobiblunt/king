<p>The experience of the team which spans more than 10 years in this sector enables us to not only offer fully compliant and authorised escrow and custodian facilities regardless of complexity, but also allows us to offer draw-down facilities, bench-mark and stage payments, and as we have our own qualified legal associates, offer tri-party agreements where required.</p>

<p>Every new contract is subject to our stringent in-house due diligence procedures. We reserve the right to decline to offer our services once we have conducted due diligence or if we consider that the transaction does not meet legal standards, misrepresents or may be fraudulent.</p>
