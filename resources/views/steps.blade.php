      <p>As well as the buying and selling of aircraft, today there is also a growth in escrows for financial protection where an aircraft is booked for charter flights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As air travel becomes even more commonplace we are seeing that those booking private charter flights are seeking ways of protecting their financial investment until their flight takes off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply, the deposits are held in an escrow account until the flight occurs, and in some cases, even more protection may be afforded as some operators ask for payment in full &#8211; in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the charter operator ceased trading or ran into other difficulties, there is a risk that the advanced payments may be lost. This risk is reduced by holding the funds in an escrow account. </p>
