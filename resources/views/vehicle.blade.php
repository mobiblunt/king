<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle escrows have seen wide use in the United States, where traditionally a cheque is made for the purchase prior to title transfer, but now it is common practice to place the money into an escrow, guaranteeing safety until all the paperwork is completed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing vehicles overseas, many purchasers and sellers have found Letters of Credit difficult and at times impractical, but with a secure escrow account the transaction can be relatively straight-forward. This may involve ensuring delivery takes place, ensuring that the conditions are met, and that the ownership titles are in order, and, of course, that the vehicle is what it purports to be. </p>
