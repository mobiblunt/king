Both of these are exciting opportunities that come with risks for both importers and exporters.</p>
<p><a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The International Trade Administration’s Trade Finance Guide</a> says that an escrow service is a cash-in-advance option available to exporters and importers that reduces the potential risk of fraud. An escrow service acts as a trusted third party that collects, holds and disburses funds according to agreed-upon instructions from the exporter and importer in the transaction. Formerly, companies were forced to use expensive and time-consuming letters of credit from a bank guaranteeing the importer’s payment.</p>
<p>Escrow services like PaySAFE® provide a simple and cost-effective workflow for completing the transaction quickly and protecting both parties:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The importer or the exporter completes an online contract outlining the terms of the sale, including purchase price and expectations for when funds will be released to the exporter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The other party reviews the transaction terms and approves the escrow contract.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The importer sends the agreed-upon purchase amount to the escrow service.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After payment is verified, the exporter is instructed to ship the goods. Upon delivery, the importer has a predetermined amount of time to inspect and accept the goods in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once accepted, the funds are released by the escrow service to the exporter. The escrow fee can either be paid in full by one party or split evenly between the importer and the exporter.</p>
<p>The Trade Finance Guide also points out that any sale is considered a gift until payment is received. PaySAFE® requires the importer to pay into the escrow account with a wire transfer, guaranteed funds for the exporter’s protection. PaySAFE also distributes funds via a wire for speed and guarantee of funds.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the Trade Finance Guide, different payment types present different risks to exporters and importers, and, for a variety of reasons, not all of the identified methods of payment are available (or desirable) to both parties.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Trade Finance Guide illustrates payment methods as more or less secure for importers or exporters:</p>
<p><a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="size-full wp-image-5844" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="198" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods.jpg 450w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods-200x88.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The Guide recommends escrow services for “transactions with importers who demand assurance that the goods will be sent in exchange for advance payment,” and states that “escrow in international trade is a service that allows both exporter and importer to protect a transaction by placing the funds in the hands of a trusted third party until a specified set of conditions are met.”</p>
<p>Given the risk inherent in new trade relationships, escrow services can offer a mutually-beneficial, cash-in-advance method for importers and exporters in a variety of circumstances. Trade partners in new relationships or relationships that have presented difficulty in the past benefit from credit enhancements; and small companies for which letters of credit are too costly and time-consuming to complete benefit from a simplified and cost-effective workflow. Escrow is a tool that protects all parties and encourages international trade.</p>

Some seek out only pick-ups or brand make-specific vehicles. Others look for long-term restoration projects and others want to add a modern twist to a classic style. Among the many groups of collectors there are also those that seek out matching number classic cars. <a title="Number Matching on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_matching" target="_blank">Matching number classic cars</a> vary from non-matching models in one very important way &#8211; all the serial numbers on specific parts match the numbers on the vehicles original number plate.<br />
<strong><em>Why would I want part numbers to match?</em></strong><br />
Manufacturers began placing serial numbers on major car components when vehicle ownership began to boom. This allowed manufacturers to track mass production over an increasingly larger number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines across the country. As these classic cars from the 50s and 60s have aged, many have had replacement parts installed when original components wore out or were destroyed. Because of that fact, finding a vehicle with all of its original, matching part numbers is becoming increasingly rare. To some, these matching number vehicles are the holy grail of the classic and collector car world.<br />
<strong><em>What&#8217;s a number plate?</em></strong><br />
Most every driver knows about a car&#8217;s vehicle identification number, or VIN. While the VIN is easily located on most vehicles, the number plate is different and can be a bit more challenging to find and will also vary when it comes number of serial numbers listed. Common serial numbers that are included on classic car number plates are the engine, transmission, and rear axle. Some vehicles will also include numbers for parts like the carburetor and alternator.<br />
<strong><em>Is there a bare minimum?</em></strong><br />
While the definition of a matching number car will vary a bit from collector to collector, a good rule of thumb when it comes to seeking out or advertising a vehicle as &#8216;matching number&#8217; is to ensure that the engine, transmission and rear axle numbers all are original to that car&#8217;s VIN. There may be more parts that match on your car, but most collectors seeking out a matching number car will expect that those three major components match.<br />
If you have trouble locating the number plate or any of the serial numbers on your own car or one that you&#8217;re looking to purchase, contact your local make-specific car club. These hobbyists and experts are pros when it comes to locating these numbers and can be a huge help in determining whether the vehicle in question is a true matching number car. You can <a title="Hemmings' Car Club Finder" href="http://www.hemmings.com/clubs/" target="_blank">find a local car club</a> through Hemmings&#8217; handy car club finder or by asking around at any local car show.<br />

And just as savvy buyers can save a boatload when purchasing a used car, smart outdoorsmen and women can save a great deal by purchasing a used RV. However, there are always a few important considerations you should examine before <a title="Buying a Car on Craigslist" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/06/10/buying-a-car-on-craigslist/">purchasing a used vehicle</a> &#8211; especially one designed to be used in the not-so-forgiving great outdoors.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Needs</em></strong><br />
There area several classes of RVs. From simple fifth wheel trailers that can be towed behind mid-sized vehicles to tour bus-sized luxury cruisers that contain any amenity you can conceive of. If you&#8217;re looking for somewhere to simply stash your gear while you do some rock climbing your needs will be very different compared to someone looking to take a cross country trip with a family of six. Planning for your needs can help you avoid getting too little &#8211; or too much &#8211; RV.<br />
<strong><em>Prepare for Maintenance</em></strong><br />
RVs have all the maintenance and upkeep associated with both a home and a vehicle. As a result, it&#8217;s important to take regular maintenance into account when you&#8217;re looking at the RVs condition. How extensive is the plumbing? Is the electrical a plug-in 120V line or is it run by a generator? Because it takes the hardest beating, how well maintained is the roof? All of these things need to be considered when putting together an offer for any used RV you might find. It&#8217;s also extremely important to find out if your RV comes with any warranties or service guarantees. Those types of agreements can be real life savers in the event of an unexpected breakdown soon after your purchase.<br />
<strong><em>Test it All Out</em></strong><br />
Like we mentioned before, RVs have amenities and functionality of both a home and a vehicle. Because there are so many different items included, you&#8217;ll need to really take your time and go through any potential purchase with a fine toothed comb. Does the shower work? Does the flooring need to be replaced? Are all the weatherproof seals in good condition? Pay particular attention to the roof of any RV as most are nearly flat. This will be one of the first places to develop leaks that can lead to hidden water damage throughout the entire vehicle.<br />
As we&#8217;ve recommended in previous posts, your best bet will be to ensure that any potential purchase is <a title="Why Get a Vehicle Inspection?" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/24/why-get-a-vehicle-inspection/">inspected by a professional</a>. In lieu of an RV professional, you&#8217;re best is to bring in a seasoned RV owner who can help guide you through and inspection or bidding process &#8211; especially if this your first RV purchase.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Taking these steps will help you.</h3>
<p>In a market rife with  fraud and product misrepresentation, buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Buyers want confidence that the vehicle is what the seller says it is and that they will not be the victims of fraud. Here are five steps that car buyers can take to minimize risk in .</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Inspection:</u></strong> You need to verify that the car is in the same condition as described in the ad.  You can have the seller take the car to a dealer close to them to do an inspection or there are independent inspection companies like <a href="http://wegolook.com">WeGoLook.com</a> which will dispatch an inspector to photograph or video the car.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping:</span></strong> Do not under estimate how much it will cost to transport the car to you or how complicated the process of finding a transporter is! There are companies like <a href="http://uship.com">uShip.com</a> that will help narrow your search options and give you a range of prices to choose from.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase agreement:</span></strong>  Set exact expectations up front with a purchase agreement.  This is often over looked for online purchases. You want to detail in writing, signed by both parties, what exactly is and isn&#8217;t included in the sale and the condition of the item. It is better to agree over whether the winter tires are included or are not now than 2 weeks later after the sale is done.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfer purchase price:</strong> </span> This is the key point of terror for you, the buyer. The realization that you are going to wire tens of thousands of dollars cross country to a person you do not know for a car you have not touched and HOPE it shows up at your place in 10 days.  Luckily there is a company,<a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow"> PaySAFEescrow.com</a>, that handles this (and all 5 of these items) for you. Pay SAFE Escrow, Inc is an online escrow company that provides an easy to follow online workflow to properly document, track communication and transfer money safely.  PaySAFE holds the purchase amount in escrow until the transaction is complete than PaySAFE releases the funds directly to the seller.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Documentation:</strong></span> Just when you thought you were done, there is more paperwork.  You, the buyer, will need to register the car in your state and transfer ownership.  You will need the seller to sign a Bill of Sale and properly sign the back of the car title to transfer ownership into your name. Make sure the seller has all this documentation completed before the seller receives the funds.</li>

Much like classic car fans, spring is also a perfect time for motorcycle enthusiasts to upgrade their current bikes or possibly add another to their collection. But before you go out and snatch up the first chopper you see, there are a few tips any buyer should heed.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
While the components are more easily visible on a motorcycle when compared to a car, that doesn&#8217;t mean a brief once-over is all you&#8217;ll need for an inspection. If you&#8217;re buying from a private seller, find a certified motorcycle mechanic in your area and see if the seller is willing to bring the bike to that mechanic for an inspection. If they&#8217;re unwilling to do so, you&#8217;ll need to find a way to bring a mechanic to the bike or potentially pass on the purchase if you&#8217;re uncomfortable with a vehicle that hasn&#8217;t undergone an inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Skill Level</em></strong><br />
There are varying levels of skill when it comes to riding a motorcycle. If you&#8217;re new to a bike, buying a high-performance crotch rocket is probably a bit much for your first purchase. It&#8217;s also important to recognize that, while some skills will easily transfer between styles of motorcycles, each style will have its own idiosyncrasies. Dirt bikes a quite different from customer choppers just as street bikes vary quite a bit compared to classic Indian motorcycles. Purchasing a bike greatly beyond your own skill level can be just as bad as buying a motorcycle with frame damage or a blown engine.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Overpay</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s important to factor in all the expenses that come with owning a motorcycle. Not only do you need to pay close attention to the price of the bike itself &#8211; noting comparative pricing for similar bikes, condition and mileage &#8211; but also factor in costs for insurance, licensing, registration and insurance. Depending on where you live, you may also need to purchase a certified <a title="Motorcycle Helmet on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_helmet" target="_blank">motorcycle helmet</a> before you hit the road. These additional expenses can quick drive the total price of ownership much higher than you had anticipated.<br />
<strong><em>Buying Site Unseen</em></strong><br />
This is a risky proposition regardless of what you&#8217;re looking to purchase, but with a vehicle you can get yourself into some sticky situations buying site unseen. If this is the only way you&#8217;re able to complete a purchase or sale for one reason or another, protecting yourself with an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Vehicle Escrow Services" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service is a great way to go. Online escrow provides a way to hold purchase funds with a neutral third party until the bike arrives and you&#8217;ve had the chance to get things a once over. It also helps sellers in that purchase funds are verified upfront, so you know the buyer is genuinely interested and not just window shopping.<br />
Regardless of the type of motorcycle you&#8217;re looking to purchase, following the steps above can help you ensure that your perfect, two-wheeled dream chopper doesn&#8217;t turn into a financial nightmare.</p>

When you&#8217;re dealing with power plants and components that weigh hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds traditional shipping over any long distance can prove exceptionally challenging. Throw in the additional requirements of international shipping and it&#8217;s perfectly understandable that some buyers or sellers would simply throw their hands in the air and pass on any offers coming in from overseas.<br />
However, knowing your shipping options ahead of time means buyers and sellers need not pass up on the potential cash cow that is international machinery sales. While there are definitely more steps that need to be taken, they aren&#8217;t so daunting as to avoid shipping internationally entirely.</p>
<p><strong><em>RO-RO Shipping</em></strong><br />
One of the most common methods of shipping vehicles and heavy equipment is roll on-roll off shipping, or RO-RO. Almost exactly what it sounds like, this type of overseas shipping is designed for self-propelled machinery that can be driven on and off of the transport ship on wheel, treads or tracks. While <a title="RO-RO Shipping on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RO-RO  shipping</a> is extremely common, it can also require a great deal of lead time. Space on RO-RO ships is in high demand and space for heavy machinery can be reduced or eliminated with little notice. Shipping to or from ports during a high volume season &#8211; like Japan during the rollout of a new year of vehicles &#8211; can also mean the need for flexibility on the part of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flat-Rack Shipping</em></strong><br />
For machinery and equipment that cannot be driven on or off of a vessel, flat-rack shipping is an option. Similar to being loaded onto a flat-bed truck, these open containers come in 20-40ft dimensions and can support up to 67,000 pounds. These open-style racks also come with tethers to secure machinery safely to the bed of the rack and side walls still allow for stacking once onboard the ship. If used for machinery, these types of shipping racks may require the shipper to disassemble component in order to fit within the confines of the shipping rack.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1605 alignleft" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg?w=300" alt="Freight-Container-sizes" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg 849w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Container Shipping</em></strong><br />
Probably the most common type of overseas shipping that comes to mind, container shipping is similar to open flat-rack shipping in dimensions and weight limits, but completely enclosed. This type of shipping method will likely require any machine to be disassembled, at least in part, and may also require more than one container to accommodate all of the components. For unusually tall machinery, open-top containers are also available as well as refrigerated containers should temperature control be an issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Select a Shipper &amp; Customs Services</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve settled on the type of shipping you need to accommodate your machinery shipment, the next step is to find a shipping and logistics company that has the experience to schedule, reserve and arrange proper documentation. It&#8217;s also important to discuss customs services with your shipping coordinator. Depending on the shipper, customs services may or may not be included in the shipping fees. You may also need to seek third party assistance for customs services if they aren&#8217;t offered through your shipper. The Federal Maritime Commission also has a listing of <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - OTI List" href="http://www2.fmc.gov/oti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">licensed international shippers</a> that can be a great help.</p>
<p><strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Now that you&#8217;ve sorted out the shipping methods best suited for your machinery, make sure you have funds for the transaction locked in as well. <a title="PaySAFE® Escrow - International Trade" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/international-trading-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online escrow services</a> are a great way to ensure that both buyer and seller are protected &#8211; especially when both parties are relative unknowns to each other. With escrow, buyers no longer need to worry about paying in advance and simply hoping their purchase shows up. Sellers also gain the advantage of knowing that purchase funds are verified up front and held securely with a neutral third party &#8211; completely eliminating the risk of non-payment. Heavy equipment transactions done online or via auction can be risky, and you want to have the confidence that the other party is legitimate. Buyers and sellers of heavy equipment trust PaySAFE® Escrow to facilitate transactions in a process that makes the transfer of assets safe, secure and simple. </p>
<p>Regardless of which shipping method you and your counterpart decide upon, never feel badly for asking additional questions. Doing some background work ahead of any potential international sale can make the process much less daunting and help to avoid any delays.</p>

Tens of thousands of items are sold on a regular basis accounting for tens of millions of dollars. Unfortunately, anytime there is that much money at stake there are those who attempt to pass off reproduction or doctored everyday firearms as rare, one-of-a-kind finds. If you&#8217;re looking to add to your current antique firearms collection, or to simply test out the market for the first time, the tips below can help you take the first steps in determining whether or not an advertised item is genuine or fake.<br />
<strong><em>Patina</em></strong><br />
In its most basic definition, <a title="Definitions of Patina on Wikiepedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina" target="_blank">patina </a>is the coating that develops on the surface of any object that is used, exposed to the elements or is handled by humans with any sort of regularity. Specifically, patina on antique firearms occurs on the exterior and is commonly seen on antique firearms. Patina is important because it takes years and years to develop on any object, thus often validating age claims of various antiques. While patina is a simple thing to look for in an advertised antique or collector firearm, be wary. Patina CAN be faked or accelerated by soaking or dabbing various chemicals on to the surface of metals. The best way to determine whether the patina on a specific firearm is real, retouched, or forged is to have a professional appraiser or other collector review the item to ensure authenticity.<br />
<strong><em>Maker&#8217;s Marks</em></strong><br />
Not to be confused with the brand of whiskey, maker&#8217;s marks &#8211; also known as manufacturer markings or proof marks &#8211; are also key in establishing the age and authenticity of any firearm. True craftsmen and gunsmiths have always left their unique markings on any piece they create, so any firearm completely lacking in proof marks or stamping should immediately raise a red flag. These markings help establish the firearm&#8217;s country of origin, year of manufacture, materials used and potentially even the gunsmith who created the weapon.<br />
While the location of these markings will vary from item to item, there are established, well-researched markings that have stood the test of time. The National Rifle Association has a <a title="NRA Museum - Proof Markings PDF" href="http://www.nramuseum.org/media/940944/proofmarks.pdf" target="_blank">free proof markings document</a> that can be of great help in learning the basics. However, proof marks can also be altered or stamped onto a reproduction firearms in attempts to boost the item&#8217;s value. As always, if you&#8217;re not a seasoned collector your best bet to validate the authenticity of any proof or maker&#8217;s marks will be to consult an appraiser.<br />
<strong><em>Serial Numbers</em></strong><br />
Much like proof marks, serial numbers on antique firearms were used for the same purposes then as they are today. As manufacturing became more automated, serial numbers were stamped onto specific components for quality assurance and testing purposes. As with vehicles, as these firearms aged and/or were damaged, various parts may have been swapped out to ensure that the gun stayed in good working order. This can lead to a mixing of serial numbers on any given firearm. As with matching number cars, matching number firearms are quickly becoming extremely rare and forgers have taken it upon themselves to falsify serial numbers of mixed number guns to increase their potential value. Again, the best way to ensure that the serial numbers on any firearm are authentic is to have them verified by a professional appraiser or collector if you&#8217;re not 100% familiar with the process yourself.<br />
While all of the above topics will give any casual or beginning collector a solid start when it comes to checking on the authenticity of any purchase, serious collectors of high-value firearms will definitely want to ensure that a potential purchase is reviewed by an independent or auction house appraiser. These professionals dedicate their lives to knowing all of the minute differences between firearms that can greatly effect the item&#8217;s overall value. As always, if something seems to good to be true, it often is.</p>

While it can be task enough winterizing your home for strong, northerly winds and snow you also need to pay some close attention to how you prepare your classic cars for the winter season. Although we&#8217;re already in the heart of winter, there are still some great tips and any classic car owner should pay attention to &#8211; especially if this is your first time storing a classic car in the off-season.<br />
<em><strong>Take a Load Off</strong></em><br />
If you haven&#8217;t done this already, lifting your vehicle on jacks while in storage can help save tires from flat spots and suspensions from constant compression. Sitting in one position for four to five months would be dangerous for you, and can be equally risky for your car.<br />
<em><strong>Keep a Full Tank</strong></em><br />
Most of us will try to get as much as we can out of a tank of gas these days, but wrapping up your vintage ride for the winter on fumes isn&#8217;t smart. Make sure that you fill up your car completely before storage with as high of an octane fuel as is available. Higher octane fuels breakdown more slowly and will keep their chemical structure in tact more securely than lower octane fuels. You can help avoid the fuel breakdown almost completely by adding in a bottle of fuel stabilizer to the tank as well.<br />
<em><strong>Pull the Battery</strong></em><br />
Winter is hard on ALL car batteries, but it&#8217;s especially hard on batteries that are cycled regularly. To save yourself some hassle come spring time, remove the battery from your car before storage and consider storing it in a more temperate place &#8211; like your basement.<br />
<em><strong>Keep it Clean</strong></em><br />
If you didn&#8217;t give your baby a thorough cleaning before you put her away for the winter you had better get on it when the next nice day rolls around. A dirty vehicle will corrode much more quickly as compounds are allowed to slowly burrow their way in during the winter months. Make sure your car is spotless, and invest in a good quality, breathable car cover as well. This will allow any moisture that accumulates on the vehicle to evaporate away as opposed to being trapped under the cover and on top of your beautiful paint job.<br />
<em><strong>Rev It Up</strong></em><br />
When you&#8217;ve got 30 minutes or so to spare on a nicer winter day, stop by and let your car run for a bit. Few things are as dangerous for a car as inactivity, so make sure to stop by every 60 days or so and let it run for about 30 minutes. This will give any fluids a chance to get warmed up and circulated so that all the components stay in good working order.<br />
No matter where you may spend your winter months, make sure that any vehicle that you place into storage is left in as pristine a condition as possible. Not only will it ensure that your classic car stays in good condition, but winterizing properly will mean less time getting things running in the spring and more time on the road!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png"><img id="i-1206" class=" wp-image alignright" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png?w=487" alt="Image" width="204" height="204" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever purchased a home &#8211; or even looked into the process behind purchasing a home &#8211; you&#8217;ve probably seen the term &#8216;escrow&#8217; quite a bit. In the most basic layman&#8217;s terms, an escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third party; usually associated with high-value purchases.</p>
<p>But <a title="Escrow account on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow_account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow accounts</a> aren&#8217;t unique to real estate. These types of accounts can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction.</p>
<p>For example, say you were looking to purchase a classic car or a boat for your family vacations. Once you&#8217;ve located the pre-owned vehicle you want, you now are stuck dealing with a relative stranger for a purchase north of $10,000. How do you hold the seller accountable and ensure that you don&#8217;t fall victim to an online scam? Often <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online escrow</a> accounts help to fill that gray area between a buyer and seller who are unknown to each other.</p>
<h5>How Escrow Works</h5>
<p>As a neutral third party, the escrow company works to keep honest people honest and ensure that both parties can complete the transaction with much greater confidence than a money order or personal check. The buyer can transfer in the funds for the purchase knowing that it will be held in trust until they give the green light. The seller knows that the funds are available as soon as they provide the vehicle or goods to the buyer. The escrow company also has the ability to release partial funds to help with things like transportation or repair costs prior to the buyer receiving their purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, escrow accounts have greater use than real estate transactions. Anytime there are buyers and sellers looking for an extra layer of security in their deals, online escrow accounts are a great place to start.<br />
Have you ever used an online escrow company outside of real estate purchases? What did you find beneficial or difficult?</p>

The last two months of each year we all take a step back and enjoy the time we have with friends and family. It&#8217;s also a time of year that involves the largest uptick in shopping for many families as we purchase tasty treats and gifts for Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas and numerous other occasions. Unfortunately, this time of year also sees a spike in the number of scams &#8211; both online and off &#8211; that can ruin anyone&#8217;s holiday. So, to keep your yuletide merry, follow some of the simple fraud prevention tips below.<br />
<a href="http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/11/24/how-to-avoid-holiday-travel-scams/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Flight/Travel Scams:</em></strong></a><br />
With family and friends strung across the country, most Americans will do at least a little bit of traveling this holiday season. Scammers know this as well, and will often send offer of &#8216;free airfare&#8217; via email, fax or snail mail. These letters will often bare logos with striking resemblances to legitimate airlines or travel sites, but are actually phishing schemes designed to steal your personal information and/or credit card numbers. Always be sure to call and validate a deal that seems too good to be true, and NEVER give out your personal or banking information via email.<br />
<em><strong>Online Shopping Scams:</strong></em><br />
Cyber Monday is arguably the largest day of online shopping in the world. As we take the the web for great deals, scammers take to the web as well. Be sure to shop only on websites that offer Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protection or that bare the verification of third-party organizations like the Better Business Bureau or TRUSTe. Using your credit card also provides a layer of protection as you can easily contest any suspicious charges.<br />
<em><strong>Charity Scams:</strong></em><br />
Sadly, in a season of giving there are those who would take advantage of our good nature for their own purposes. There are many &#8216;sound alike&#8217; charities that pop up around the holidays. Use of the words &#8216;salvation&#8217; or &#8216;cancer&#8217; don&#8217;t always mean that a charity is legitimate. Giving online can also have pitfalls. Simply because a website ends with a .org doesn&#8217;t mean that the organization is an actual 501c(3) charity. When in doubt, call your charity of choice directly or visit them in person to make your holiday donations.<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=door-to-door+holiday+scams" target="_blank"><em><strong>Door-to-Door Scams:</strong></em></a><br />
Despite the cold weather in most of the country, this time of year sees an increase in door-to-door scams as well. These scammers will often pose as the on the ground representatives of charitable organizations or even tradespeople. Don&#8217;t fall victim to high-pressure sales techniques or sob stories that they may present. Again, when in doubt, tell them you&#8217;ll call the company yourself or give in-person at the organization&#8217;s local office. Some states also require a peddler&#8217;s license when selling door-to-door. Be sure to know the rules in your state and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for identification or proof that individuals are actually working with the company or organization they claim to represent.<br />
While <a title="Holiday Season Scams on Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/10/credit-cards-gifts-charity-internet-personal-finance-holiday-scams_slide_11.html" target="_blank">holiday season scams</a> don&#8217;t tend to vary greatly in substance when compared to the rest of the calendar year, these types of risks do tend to increase during the holidays. However, keeping tabs on your local news and following the tips above can help to keep your holidays season free of bad tidings.</p>
