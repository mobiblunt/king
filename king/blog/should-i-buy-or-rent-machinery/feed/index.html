					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of renting a little more since you mentioned that the insurance and maintenance are covered by the owner of the machine. I work for a small company that doesn&#039;t have a lot of room in the budget for ongoing costs like insuring more equipment than we already have. We&#039;ll have to keep this in mind so we aren&#039;t paying more than we need to for our projects!]]></description>
