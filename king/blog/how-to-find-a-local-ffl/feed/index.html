					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Accessories and Gun Parts There are a few components in rifles and pistols that are considered &#8216;firearms&#8217; in the eyes of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Those pieces not considered firearms by the ATF are not held to the same restrictions as the entire firearm itself. Examples of items that may not be restricted include rifle stocks or pistol grips, hunting scopes, carrying straps, holsters and/or laser sights. Again, as restrictions change with relative frequency, if you&#8217;re unsure as to whether or not a component qualifies as a &#8216;firearm&#8217; according to the ATF check with your local FFL.
