					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t really aware of the popularity surrounding antique gun collecting. They do have a long history and are very interesting but I am glad you have touched upon the subject of shipping them. Do you think enough is being done to educate people on the rules and regulations surrounding firearm transportation? Sometimes it can be quite confusing. Moreover, each country and area tends to have its own set of laws. I really like the point you make a bout shipping an antique firearm as a modern one if you aren&#039;t aware of the date because it is better to be safe than sorry. There is some really great advice in this post!]]></description>
