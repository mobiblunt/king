Some seek out only pick-ups or brand make-specific vehicles. Others look for long-term restoration projects and others want to add a modern twist to a classic style. Among the many groups of collectors there are also those that seek out matching number classic cars. <a title="Number Matching on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_matching" target="_blank">Matching number classic cars</a> vary from non-matching models in one very important way &#8211; all the serial numbers on specific parts match the numbers on the vehicles original number plate.<br />
<strong><em>Why would I want part numbers to match?</em></strong><br />
Manufacturers began placing serial numbers on major car components when vehicle ownership began to boom. This allowed manufacturers to track mass production over an increasingly larger number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines across the country. As these classic cars from the 50s and 60s have aged, many have had replacement parts installed when original components wore out or were destroyed. Because of that fact, finding a vehicle with all of its original, matching part numbers is becoming increasingly rare. To some, these matching number vehicles are the holy grail of the classic and collector car world.<br />
<strong><em>What&#8217;s a number plate?</em></strong><br />
Most every driver knows about a car&#8217;s vehicle identification number, or VIN. While the VIN is easily located on most vehicles, the number plate is different and can be a bit more challenging to find and will also vary when it comes number of serial numbers listed. Common serial numbers that are included on classic car number plates are the engine, transmission, and rear axle. Some vehicles will also include numbers for parts like the carburetor and alternator.<br />
<strong><em>Is there a bare minimum?</em></strong><br />
While the definition of a matching number car will vary a bit from collector to collector, a good rule of thumb when it comes to seeking out or advertising a vehicle as &#8216;matching number&#8217; is to ensure that the engine, transmission and rear axle numbers all are original to that car&#8217;s VIN. There may be more parts that match on your car, but most collectors seeking out a matching number car will expect that those three major components match.<br />
If you have trouble locating the number plate or any of the serial numbers on your own car or one that you&#8217;re looking to purchase, contact your local make-specific car club. These hobbyists and experts are pros when it comes to locating these numbers and can be a huge help in determining whether the vehicle in question is a true matching number car. You can <a title="Hemmings' Car Club Finder" href="http://www.hemmings.com/clubs/" target="_blank">find a local car club</a> through Hemmings&#8217; handy car club finder or by asking around at any local car show.<br />

And just as savvy buyers can save a boatload when purchasing a used car, smart outdoorsmen and women can save a great deal by purchasing a used RV. However, there are always a few important considerations you should examine before <a title="Buying a Car on Craigslist" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/06/10/buying-a-car-on-craigslist/">purchasing a used vehicle</a> &#8211; especially one designed to be used in the not-so-forgiving great outdoors.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Needs</em></strong><br />
There area several classes of RVs. From simple fifth wheel trailers that can be towed behind mid-sized vehicles to tour bus-sized luxury cruisers that contain any amenity you can conceive of. If you&#8217;re looking for somewhere to simply stash your gear while you do some rock climbing your needs will be very different compared to someone looking to take a cross country trip with a family of six. Planning for your needs can help you avoid getting too little &#8211; or too much &#8211; RV.<br />
<strong><em>Prepare for Maintenance</em></strong><br />
RVs have all the maintenance and upkeep associated with both a home and a vehicle. As a result, it&#8217;s important to take regular maintenance into account when you&#8217;re looking at the RVs condition. How extensive is the plumbing? Is the electrical a plug-in 120V line or is it run by a generator? Because it takes the hardest beating, how well maintained is the roof? All of these things need to be considered when putting together an offer for any used RV you might find. It&#8217;s also extremely important to find out if your RV comes with any warranties or service guarantees. Those types of agreements can be real life savers in the event of an unexpected breakdown soon after your purchase.<br />
<strong><em>Test it All Out</em></strong><br />
Like we mentioned before, RVs have amenities and functionality of both a home and a vehicle. Because there are so many different items included, you&#8217;ll need to really take your time and go through any potential purchase with a fine toothed comb. Does the shower work? Does the flooring need to be replaced? Are all the weatherproof seals in good condition? Pay particular attention to the roof of any RV as most are nearly flat. This will be one of the first places to develop leaks that can lead to hidden water damage throughout the entire vehicle.<br />
As we&#8217;ve recommended in previous posts, your best bet will be to ensure that any potential purchase is <a title="Why Get a Vehicle Inspection?" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/24/why-get-a-vehicle-inspection/">inspected by a professional</a>. In lieu of an RV professional, you&#8217;re best is to bring in a seasoned RV owner who can help guide you through and inspection or bidding process &#8211; especially if this your first RV purchase.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Taking these steps will help you.</h3>
<p>In a market rife with  fraud and product misrepresentation, buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Buyers want confidence that the vehicle is what the seller says it is and that they will not be the victims of fraud. Here are five steps that car buyers can take to minimize risk in .</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Inspection:</u></strong> You need to verify that the car is in the same condition as described in the ad.  You can have the seller take the car to a dealer close to them to do an inspection or there are independent inspection companies like <a href="http://wegolook.com">WeGoLook.com</a> which will dispatch an inspector to photograph or video the car.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping:</span></strong> Do not under estimate how much it will cost to transport the car to you or how complicated the process of finding a transporter is! There are companies like <a href="http://uship.com">uShip.com</a> that will help narrow your search options and give you a range of prices to choose from.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase agreement:</span></strong>  Set exact expectations up front with a purchase agreement.  This is often over looked for online purchases. You want to detail in writing, signed by both parties, what exactly is and isn&#8217;t included in the sale and the condition of the item. It is better to agree over whether the winter tires are included or are not now than 2 weeks later after the sale is done.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfer purchase price:</strong> </span> This is the key point of terror for you, the buyer. The realization that you are going to wire tens of thousands of dollars cross country to a person you do not know for a car you have not touched and HOPE it shows up at your place in 10 days.  Luckily there is a company,<a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow"> PaySAFEescrow.com</a>, that handles this (and all 5 of these items) for you. Pay SAFE Escrow, Inc is an online escrow company that provides an easy to follow online workflow to properly document, track communication and transfer money safely.  PaySAFE holds the purchase amount in escrow until the transaction is complete than PaySAFE releases the funds directly to the seller.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Documentation:</strong></span> Just when you thought you were done, there is more paperwork.  You, the buyer, will need to register the car in your state and transfer ownership.  You will need the seller to sign a Bill of Sale and properly sign the back of the car title to transfer ownership into your name. Make sure the seller has all this documentation completed before the seller receives the funds.</li>

Much like classic car fans, spring is also a perfect time for motorcycle enthusiasts to upgrade their current bikes or possibly add another to their collection. But before you go out and snatch up the first chopper you see, there are a few tips any buyer should heed.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
While the components are more easily visible on a motorcycle when compared to a car, that doesn&#8217;t mean a brief once-over is all you&#8217;ll need for an inspection. If you&#8217;re buying from a private seller, find a certified motorcycle mechanic in your area and see if the seller is willing to bring the bike to that mechanic for an inspection. If they&#8217;re unwilling to do so, you&#8217;ll need to find a way to bring a mechanic to the bike or potentially pass on the purchase if you&#8217;re uncomfortable with a vehicle that hasn&#8217;t undergone an inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Skill Level</em></strong><br />
There are varying levels of skill when it comes to riding a motorcycle. If you&#8217;re new to a bike, buying a high-performance crotch rocket is probably a bit much for your first purchase. It&#8217;s also important to recognize that, while some skills will easily transfer between styles of motorcycles, each style will have its own idiosyncrasies. Dirt bikes a quite different from customer choppers just as street bikes vary quite a bit compared to classic Indian motorcycles. Purchasing a bike greatly beyond your own skill level can be just as bad as buying a motorcycle with frame damage or a blown engine.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Overpay</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s important to factor in all the expenses that come with owning a motorcycle. Not only do you need to pay close attention to the price of the bike itself &#8211; noting comparative pricing for similar bikes, condition and mileage &#8211; but also factor in costs for insurance, licensing, registration and insurance. Depending on where you live, you may also need to purchase a certified <a title="Motorcycle Helmet on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_helmet" target="_blank">motorcycle helmet</a> before you hit the road. These additional expenses can quick drive the total price of ownership much higher than you had anticipated.<br />
<strong><em>Buying Site Unseen</em></strong><br />
This is a risky proposition regardless of what you&#8217;re looking to purchase, but with a vehicle you can get yourself into some sticky situations buying site unseen. If this is the only way you&#8217;re able to complete a purchase or sale for one reason or another, protecting yourself with an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Vehicle Escrow Services" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service is a great way to go. Online escrow provides a way to hold purchase funds with a neutral third party until the bike arrives and you&#8217;ve had the chance to get things a once over. It also helps sellers in that purchase funds are verified upfront, so you know the buyer is genuinely interested and not just window shopping.<br />
Regardless of the type of motorcycle you&#8217;re looking to purchase, following the steps above can help you ensure that your perfect, two-wheeled dream chopper doesn&#8217;t turn into a financial nightmare.</p>

While it can be task enough winterizing your home for strong, northerly winds and snow you also need to pay some close attention to how you prepare your classic cars for the winter season. Although we&#8217;re already in the heart of winter, there are still some great tips and any classic car owner should pay attention to &#8211; especially if this is your first time storing a classic car in the off-season.<br />
<em><strong>Take a Load Off</strong></em><br />
If you haven&#8217;t done this already, lifting your vehicle on jacks while in storage can help save tires from flat spots and suspensions from constant compression. Sitting in one position for four to five months would be dangerous for you, and can be equally risky for your car.<br />
<em><strong>Keep a Full Tank</strong></em><br />
Most of us will try to get as much as we can out of a tank of gas these days, but wrapping up your vintage ride for the winter on fumes isn&#8217;t smart. Make sure that you fill up your car completely before storage with as high of an octane fuel as is available. Higher octane fuels breakdown more slowly and will keep their chemical structure in tact more securely than lower octane fuels. You can help avoid the fuel breakdown almost completely by adding in a bottle of fuel stabilizer to the tank as well.<br />
<em><strong>Pull the Battery</strong></em><br />
Winter is hard on ALL car batteries, but it&#8217;s especially hard on batteries that are cycled regularly. To save yourself some hassle come spring time, remove the battery from your car before storage and consider storing it in a more temperate place &#8211; like your basement.<br />
<em><strong>Keep it Clean</strong></em><br />
If you didn&#8217;t give your baby a thorough cleaning before you put her away for the winter you had better get on it when the next nice day rolls around. A dirty vehicle will corrode much more quickly as compounds are allowed to slowly burrow their way in during the winter months. Make sure your car is spotless, and invest in a good quality, breathable car cover as well. This will allow any moisture that accumulates on the vehicle to evaporate away as opposed to being trapped under the cover and on top of your beautiful paint job.<br />
<em><strong>Rev It Up</strong></em><br />
When you&#8217;ve got 30 minutes or so to spare on a nicer winter day, stop by and let your car run for a bit. Few things are as dangerous for a car as inactivity, so make sure to stop by every 60 days or so and let it run for about 30 minutes. This will give any fluids a chance to get warmed up and circulated so that all the components stay in good working order.<br />
No matter where you may spend your winter months, make sure that any vehicle that you place into storage is left in as pristine a condition as possible. Not only will it ensure that your classic car stays in good condition, but winterizing properly will mean less time getting things running in the spring and more time on the road!</p>

However, there is one form of paperwork that really shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as quite a burden: a purchase agreement.<br />
We all want to believe the best in the people with which we interact, and this includes those that we buy from and sell to. But the harsh reality is that we live in a very litigious time and in a very litigious country where, often times, the only things that can save our hides are the documents we have to support one side of a story or another. Because of this, purchase agreements are a must have anytime you buy or sell an item of significant value.<br />
<em><strong>Purchase Agreement Basics</strong></em><br />
While purchase agreements don&#8217;t have to be overly complex, there are definitely a few items that you should always be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of both parties entering into the agreement</li>
<li>Item(s) being sold and any warrantees or representations, or if the item is being sold &#8216;as-is&#8217;</li>
<li>Total purchase price</li>
<li>Current location and condition of the item being sold</li>
<li>Details as to how payment will be completed &#8211; especially if there are multiple payments or payment is contingent on items like repairs, completed projects or inspections.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction of disputes</li>
<li>Signatures &#8211; including dates if possible &#8211; for all parties involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to peace of mind, purchase agreements are required a number of different scenarios. Interstate commerce requires purchase agreements to be included with any shipments. <a title="International Shipping Tips &amp; Tricks" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/12/international-shipping-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">International commerce</a> requires purchase agreements in order to pass through customs. The government also requires a purchase agreement for taxation purposes.<br />
Aside from the number of entities that require this type of paperwork, written agreements allow for both the buyer and seller to plan for a worst case scenario. While most transactions go through with little friction, planning for the worst will ensure that both parties can rest easy knowing that a plan of action is in place.</p>

Any car collector worth his salt knows that there are many levels of value for any make and model. Because small variations can greatly affect the cumulative value of your classic dream car, it&#8217;s important to get a ballpark value for varying condition of your ideal purchase.<br />
Since not everyone is fortunate enough to have an idedic memory, companies like Hagerty Insurance have put together <a title="Hagerty's Vehicle Valuation Tool" href="http://www.hagerty.com/valuationtools/HVT/VehicleSearch" target="_blank">valuation tools</a> for classic vehicles. As a quick example of the breadth in value based on condition, a 1965 Ford Mustang 2-door Coupe can range from an estimated high-end value of nearly $50,000 down to barely $17,000.<br />
So, once you&#8217;ve found your unicorn don&#8217;t let emotion override logic. Be sure to get a good idea as to the fair market value of any vehicle purchase based on condition and any potential repairs.<br />
Below is a short list of some good places to start when it comes to vehicle valuations:</p>

Congrats! Now comes the task of making sure it arrives safely from the seller, who just happens to live across the country. When you&#8217;re looking to ship any type of vehicle over a long distance there are a few items that you need to keep in mind to ensure your dream purchase doesn&#8217;t turn into a nightmare:<br />
<em><strong>1. Prepare</strong></em><br />
Any shipping company will want some basic information before they can give an estimate or schedule for pick-up. Items like the exact weight and dimensions of your vehicle can greatly effect the requirements for the shipper. Oversized vehicles like SUVs or custom designs can also incur extra fees, so be sure to ask additional questions if your dream car goes beyond traditional dimensions. Also be sure to thoroughly read through any paperwork &#8211; especially the <a title="Bill of Lading on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading" target="_blank">bill of lading</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s presented once the shipper arrives.<br />
<em><strong>2. Know Your Shipping Options</strong></em><br />
There&#8217;s definitely more than one way to ship a car. Some of the most common types of shipping vessels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enclosed or open containers</li>
<li>Multi-car trailer trucks or a pick-up, often called a hotshot</li>
<li>Non-stacking trailers</li>
<li>Multi-level carriers (you see these commonly at dealerships)</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of shipping options you choose will likely vary depending on the type of vehicle you&#8217;re shipping. You may also want to look around for shippers who specialize in a specific type of vehicle as well, such as classic cars or off-road vehicles.<br />
<em><strong>3. Know Your Shipper</strong></em><br />
Do some ground work and background research on any person or company that offers to ship your vehicle. It never hurts to ask about items like insurance, certifications and/or if the person your speaking with is a broker or the actual shipper. Much like researching a contractor or plumber, car shippers can vary from business to business.<br />
Above all else, never feel silly for asking questions. If you&#8217;re uncertain about any items that the shipper addressed, or not addressed, be sure to ask. And, as always, remember that if something seems too good to be true, it likely is.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a> and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2199 size-medium" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flooded-street.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" />Here&#8217;s fair warning when buying a new or used car after a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy &#8212; hundreds of thousands of cars have been recently submerged or flooded and <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/flooded-car-totalled" target="_blank">effectively totaled</a>, yet many of these will end up for sale in car lots and on online marketplaces disguised as undamaged new or used vehicles. And not only should those living in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and surrounding areas worry, these cars are easy to ship and will likely end up for sale all over the country.<br />
Being submerged in water can cause a number of problems for a car, affecting brakes, clutch, accelerator, electrical system, transmission, drivetrain and the engine as well as fuel and power steering systems. Unless dirt and other contaminants are completely removed from all of these vital components (which is not an easy, let alone cheap task), the car will suffer from increased wear and premature failure.<br />
AAA offers the following tips on how to recognize a flood-damaged car.<br />
<strong>Use your senses.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs of water damage, including water lines on headlights and elsewhere.</li>
<li>Do a thorough inspection by checking for mud, mildew or other residue under carpets, on the trunk floor and other enclosed areas like door panels and the gas tank, paying close attention to tiny hard-to-clean crevices.</li>
<li>Any unusual smells, such as dampness or mold, are red flags.</li>
<li>Turn on the engine to make sure it sounds as it should.</li>
<li>During a test drive, make sure the car &#8220;feels&#8221; right.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check under the dash.</strong><br />
Underneath the dashboard is a particularly hard area to clean. A dishonest seller looking to quickly flip the car will likely clean the rest of the car, but skip this part.<br />
<iframe width="940" height="705" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy0BuwjGfJg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<strong>Get the car&#8217;s vehicle history report.</strong><br />
Obtaining the car&#8217;s history via <a href="http://www.carfax.com/car_buying/" target="_blank">CARFAX</a> will reveal if it&#8217;s been in a major accident, such as a flood or fire. You can also check the VIN in the <a href="http://www.nicb.org/" target="_blank">National Insurance Crime Bureau</a> database of vehicles involved in recent hurricanes. This service is free-of-charge, but keep in mind it doesn’t cover all flood-damaged vehicles.<br />
<strong>Have it inspected.</strong><br />
Any car should be inspected by a quality repair facility before it&#8217;s purchased. There are plenty of mechanics out there who are trained in handling flood-damaged vehicles, so don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for a flood inspection.<br />
<strong>Use PaySAFE to avoid fraud.</strong><br />
Using PaySAFE to complete a transaction is also a great way to avoid fraud. Acting as a neutral third party escrow service, PaySAFE offers the buyer (and seller) safe, secure and easy-to-use tools to close the deal. The buyer and the seller exchange no money until all the terms of the transaction are approved.<br />
