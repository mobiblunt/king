Both of these are exciting opportunities that come with risks for both importers and exporters.</p>
<p><a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The International Trade Administration’s Trade Finance Guide</a> says that an escrow service is a cash-in-advance option available to exporters and importers that reduces the potential risk of fraud. An escrow service acts as a trusted third party that collects, holds and disburses funds according to agreed-upon instructions from the exporter and importer in the transaction. Formerly, companies were forced to use expensive and time-consuming letters of credit from a bank guaranteeing the importer’s payment.</p>
<p>Escrow services like PaySAFE® provide a simple and cost-effective workflow for completing the transaction quickly and protecting both parties:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The importer or the exporter completes an online contract outlining the terms of the sale, including purchase price and expectations for when funds will be released to the exporter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The other party reviews the transaction terms and approves the escrow contract.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The importer sends the agreed-upon purchase amount to the escrow service.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After payment is verified, the exporter is instructed to ship the goods. Upon delivery, the importer has a predetermined amount of time to inspect and accept the goods in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once accepted, the funds are released by the escrow service to the exporter. The escrow fee can either be paid in full by one party or split evenly between the importer and the exporter.</p>
<p>The Trade Finance Guide also points out that any sale is considered a gift until payment is received. PaySAFE® requires the importer to pay into the escrow account with a wire transfer, guaranteed funds for the exporter’s protection. PaySAFE also distributes funds via a wire for speed and guarantee of funds.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the Trade Finance Guide, different payment types present different risks to exporters and importers, and, for a variety of reasons, not all of the identified methods of payment are available (or desirable) to both parties.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Trade Finance Guide illustrates payment methods as more or less secure for importers or exporters:</p>
<p><a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="size-full wp-image-5844" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="198" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods.jpg 450w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods-200x88.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The Guide recommends escrow services for “transactions with importers who demand assurance that the goods will be sent in exchange for advance payment,” and states that “escrow in international trade is a service that allows both exporter and importer to protect a transaction by placing the funds in the hands of a trusted third party until a specified set of conditions are met.”</p>
<p>Given the risk inherent in new trade relationships, escrow services can offer a mutually-beneficial, cash-in-advance method for importers and exporters in a variety of circumstances. Trade partners in new relationships or relationships that have presented difficulty in the past benefit from credit enhancements; and small companies for which letters of credit are too costly and time-consuming to complete benefit from a simplified and cost-effective workflow. Escrow is a tool that protects all parties and encourages international trade.</p>

When you&#8217;re dealing with power plants and components that weigh hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds traditional shipping over any long distance can prove exceptionally challenging. Throw in the additional requirements of international shipping and it&#8217;s perfectly understandable that some buyers or sellers would simply throw their hands in the air and pass on any offers coming in from overseas.<br />
However, knowing your shipping options ahead of time means buyers and sellers need not pass up on the potential cash cow that is international machinery sales. While there are definitely more steps that need to be taken, they aren&#8217;t so daunting as to avoid shipping internationally entirely.</p>
<p><strong><em>RO-RO Shipping</em></strong><br />
One of the most common methods of shipping vehicles and heavy equipment is roll on-roll off shipping, or RO-RO. Almost exactly what it sounds like, this type of overseas shipping is designed for self-propelled machinery that can be driven on and off of the transport ship on wheel, treads or tracks. While <a title="RO-RO Shipping on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RO-RO  shipping</a> is extremely common, it can also require a great deal of lead time. Space on RO-RO ships is in high demand and space for heavy machinery can be reduced or eliminated with little notice. Shipping to or from ports during a high volume season &#8211; like Japan during the rollout of a new year of vehicles &#8211; can also mean the need for flexibility on the part of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flat-Rack Shipping</em></strong><br />
For machinery and equipment that cannot be driven on or off of a vessel, flat-rack shipping is an option. Similar to being loaded onto a flat-bed truck, these open containers come in 20-40ft dimensions and can support up to 67,000 pounds. These open-style racks also come with tethers to secure machinery safely to the bed of the rack and side walls still allow for stacking once onboard the ship. If used for machinery, these types of shipping racks may require the shipper to disassemble component in order to fit within the confines of the shipping rack.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1605 alignleft" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg?w=300" alt="Freight-Container-sizes" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg 849w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Container Shipping</em></strong><br />
Probably the most common type of overseas shipping that comes to mind, container shipping is similar to open flat-rack shipping in dimensions and weight limits, but completely enclosed. This type of shipping method will likely require any machine to be disassembled, at least in part, and may also require more than one container to accommodate all of the components. For unusually tall machinery, open-top containers are also available as well as refrigerated containers should temperature control be an issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Select a Shipper &amp; Customs Services</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve settled on the type of shipping you need to accommodate your machinery shipment, the next step is to find a shipping and logistics company that has the experience to schedule, reserve and arrange proper documentation. It&#8217;s also important to discuss customs services with your shipping coordinator. Depending on the shipper, customs services may or may not be included in the shipping fees. You may also need to seek third party assistance for customs services if they aren&#8217;t offered through your shipper. The Federal Maritime Commission also has a listing of <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - OTI List" href="http://www2.fmc.gov/oti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">licensed international shippers</a> that can be a great help.</p>
<p><strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Now that you&#8217;ve sorted out the shipping methods best suited for your machinery, make sure you have funds for the transaction locked in as well. <a title="PaySAFE® Escrow - International Trade" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/international-trading-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online escrow services</a> are a great way to ensure that both buyer and seller are protected &#8211; especially when both parties are relative unknowns to each other. With escrow, buyers no longer need to worry about paying in advance and simply hoping their purchase shows up. Sellers also gain the advantage of knowing that purchase funds are verified up front and held securely with a neutral third party &#8211; completely eliminating the risk of non-payment. Heavy equipment transactions done online or via auction can be risky, and you want to have the confidence that the other party is legitimate. Buyers and sellers of heavy equipment trust PaySAFE® Escrow to facilitate transactions in a process that makes the transfer of assets safe, secure and simple. </p>
<p>Regardless of which shipping method you and your counterpart decide upon, never feel badly for asking additional questions. Doing some background work ahead of any potential international sale can make the process much less daunting and help to avoid any delays.</p>

However, there is one form of paperwork that really shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as quite a burden: a purchase agreement.<br />
We all want to believe the best in the people with which we interact, and this includes those that we buy from and sell to. But the harsh reality is that we live in a very litigious time and in a very litigious country where, often times, the only things that can save our hides are the documents we have to support one side of a story or another. Because of this, purchase agreements are a must have anytime you buy or sell an item of significant value.<br />
<em><strong>Purchase Agreement Basics</strong></em><br />
While purchase agreements don&#8217;t have to be overly complex, there are definitely a few items that you should always be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of both parties entering into the agreement</li>
<li>Item(s) being sold and any warrantees or representations, or if the item is being sold &#8216;as-is&#8217;</li>
<li>Total purchase price</li>
<li>Current location and condition of the item being sold</li>
<li>Details as to how payment will be completed &#8211; especially if there are multiple payments or payment is contingent on items like repairs, completed projects or inspections.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction of disputes</li>
<li>Signatures &#8211; including dates if possible &#8211; for all parties involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to peace of mind, purchase agreements are required a number of different scenarios. Interstate commerce requires purchase agreements to be included with any shipments. <a title="International Shipping Tips &amp; Tricks" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/12/international-shipping-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">International commerce</a> requires purchase agreements in order to pass through customs. The government also requires a purchase agreement for taxation purposes.<br />
Aside from the number of entities that require this type of paperwork, written agreements allow for both the buyer and seller to plan for a worst case scenario. While most transactions go through with little friction, planning for the worst will ensure that both parties can rest easy knowing that a plan of action is in place.</p>

While there are definite risks when it comes to international shipping, there are a few easy tips that anyone should follow when it comes to shipping any items internationally.<br />
<strong><em>Start Small</em></strong><br />
Like most skills, arranging international shipping requires practice and repetition to make sure all your i&#8217;s are dotted and t&#8217;s are crossed. The easiest way to get the hang of things is to start be shipping small, easier-to-package items. Maybe a simple gift for your niece studying abroad for a semester or a house warming gift for that friend spending a week in Tokyo. Mastering the basics with lesser-valued items can help reduce the stress and confusing when moving on to bigger ticket purchases.<br />
<em><strong>Speak the Same Language</strong></em><br />
Start by shipping between countries that share a common language. There&#8217;s no point in adding the risk of translation errors to the mix when you may not be 100% familiar with packing requirements or postage.<br />
<em><strong>Ask the Experts</strong></em><br />
Organizations like the United States Postal Service have international shipping down to a science. The USPS&#8217; <a title="USPS International Shipping How-To Guide" href="https://www.usps.com/ship/international-how-to.htm" target="_blank">International How-To Guide</a> and <a title="USPS International Addressing Tips" href="https://www.usps.com/send/international-addressing-tips.htm" target="_blank">International Addressing Tips</a> are great places to start if you&#8217;ve never shipped internationally before.<br />
With all of the information now available on the internet, international shipping isn&#8217;t nearly as daunting of a task as it once was. However, if a Google search or Facebook post doesn&#8217;t yield the answers you&#8217;re looking for, a call to your local post office can usually help clear up and issues. Happy shipping!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a> and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/combine.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2123" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/combine.jpg?w=300" alt="combine" width="300" height="146" /></a>Because heavy equipment is the lifeblood of any farm or ranch, buying used can yield tractors and combines that are in near new condition. Most tractor and combine owners keep their equipment in as good of condition as possible, so the secondary market is an excellent stop for anyone looking for a new addition to their work shed. While most farming implements can be simple to inspect on your own, tractors and combines specifically can be a bit more tricky. To ensure that you don&#8217;t get stuck with any hidden problems in your next buying opportunity, we&#8217;ve line up some key points of inspection that should never be ignored.<br />
<strong><em>Used Combines</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compare your the combine&#8217;s engine hours vs. separator hours. Significantly longer engine hours warrants a closer inspection of the drive train and transmission.</li>
<li>Look for signs of wear on larger belts, chains and sprockets. Excessive wear can indicate poor maintenance, or extremely hard use by the current owner.</li>
<li>Be sure to note excessive play in bearings or slots while inspecting the cleaning shoe and sieve assemblies. Did you notice any spot welds or breakage?</li>
<li>If at all possible, get the combine started and running for a bit to see if you notice and audible problems like grinding, screeching, or knocking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Used Tractors</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the frame. Has it ever been spring or repaired?</li>
<li>Inspect the hydraulic and oil lines. Leaks here are common and can be repaired somewhat easily, but problems should still be noted.</li>
<li>Gives the tires a good once over. Are they in good condition, or are they going to need replacing soon?</li>
<li>Does the cab have a ROPS (rollover protection structure), or a wide enough front-end to protect against rollovers?</li>
<li>Note any aftermarket additions that the current owner may have installed. If anything has been added, you may want to cross reference or consult with a dealer to see if those modifications can be supported.</li>
<li>Start it up and drive around the yard if it&#8217;s at all possible. You&#8217;ll get a greater sense of the transmission and drive train if you&#8217;re able to get behind the wheel. This is your chance to note any slippage or shifting issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re not able to inspect the equipment yourself, consider providing a list of must-see items to a third party inspection company like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook</a>. It&#8217;s not uncommon for owners to have inspection documents or a mechanic&#8217;s history available to potential buyers, but a third party inspector can provide photos and video from a truly neutral position. The folks at WeGoLook.com can also create custom inspections to review any additional implements or accessories beyond the main equipment.<br />
The key to purchasing any previously owned equipment is to do your homework. Investing a little time and effort into research can save you hours of frustration and headaches that come with equipment that doesn&#8217;t meet work needs.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auction.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2108" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auction.jpg?w=300" alt="Andy Warhol's Mao To Be Auctioned At Christies" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auction.jpg 400w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/auction-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There was once only a single way to participate in an auction, and that was by showing up to a live event and raising your paddle or calling your bid out loud. With the advent of online and remote auctions, there are now several ways for bidders to participate, and a growing number of auction types. To make choosing the right auction for your items easier, below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the most popular types of auctions, and how each style of auction works.<br />
<strong><em>On-Site and Online Live Auctions</em></strong><br />
This type of auction is likely what most people think of when they hear the word auction. Bidding takes place in real time, and is conducted either online or in person. This is also the most straight forward way to buy or sell in an auction setting, as it is simply the person who bids the highest who walks away with the item, and all participants are able to hear each bid as it comes in.<br />
<strong><em>Webcast Auctions</em></strong><br />
Similar to live on-site auctions, these types of auctions are again conducted in real time, but the auctioneer and participants are all joined together via webcast. Lots that are up for bidding are all displayed through a webcast setting, and again, the highest bidder is the one who walks away with each lot.<br />
<strong><em>Sealed Bid Auctions</em></strong><br />
There is a greater amount of secrecy associated with sealed bid auctions as participants are unaware of what their competition is bidding. Bid are submitted to the auctioneer or auction house in sealed envelopes and, as with other auctions, the participant with the highest submitted bid will be awarded the lot.<br />
<strong><em>Timed Online Auctions</em></strong><br />
Time auctions held on sites like ebay are some of the most common web-based auctions. Sometimes created with a reserve amount and sometimes not, bidders have a number of hours, day, or weeks to bid on the lot in question. The only challenge to this type of auction is for bidders to ensure they have the last and highest bid placed before the auction closes.<br />
While there is no hard and fast rule as to what types of items are best suited to each type of auction, it ultimately comes down to how quickly the auctioneer or owner wants to sell their items.

Online buyers also have the advantage of shopping through millions of products from the comfort of their couch or office chair. While there is tremendous opportunity for both parties, how can you safely complete a transaction with someone who many not be just across town, but across the globe? Following the tips below can help to ensure that whether you&#8217;re buying or selling, you&#8217;ll always be safe.<br />
<strong><em>Keep Things Disposable</em></strong><br />
Many online auction and classified websites have their own email system where buyers and sellers can communicate within the platform. However, not all sites offer this type of functionality. If you don&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to communicate with the other party through the host sites system, consider creating a non-specific and easily deleted email account. This allows you to keep your regular emails from family and friends separated from any communications with unknown buyers and sellers. That insulation layer can also provide protection against scammers who may try to hack your email.<br />
<strong><em>Go Beyond Email</em></strong><br />
Communication through email is incredibly convenient, but it can also provide scammers a great place to hide. If you&#8217;re comfortable, attempt a phone conversation with the other party. Not only does this allow you to establish that there is a real person on the other end of the transaction, but it can be a great way to iron out details that may not translate well in an email message.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Consider using an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow is great for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially when steep price tags are involved. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs. Buyers are also protected because funds are held securely with a neutral third party, and generally aren&#8217;t released until there is proof that the item has shipped or has even arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
It not difficult to believe that any seller will always try to present their item in the best possible light. Some sellers will take things a bit too far and attempt to conceal damaged items. While you may be tempted to take the seller at their word you should always consider an inspection. Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will setup a time for one of their lookers to visit the item you&#8217;re considering, and document the actual condition of the item. Depending on your requirements, these inspectors can even shoot video, or perform custom inspections to make sure that all of your concerns are addressed.<br />
When it call comes down to it, most people are better at recognizing a potential scam than they realize. If you ever get the feeling that something just isn&#8217;t right, or that it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. In that situation you should never feel badly about simply walking away from the deal.<br />
