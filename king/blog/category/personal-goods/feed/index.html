Tens of thousands of items are sold on a regular basis accounting for tens of millions of dollars. Unfortunately, anytime there is that much money at stake there are those who attempt to pass off reproduction or doctored everyday firearms as rare, one-of-a-kind finds. If you&#8217;re looking to add to your current antique firearms collection, or to simply test out the market for the first time, the tips below can help you take the first steps in determining whether or not an advertised item is genuine or fake.<br />
<strong><em>Patina</em></strong><br />
In its most basic definition, <a title="Definitions of Patina on Wikiepedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina" target="_blank">patina </a>is the coating that develops on the surface of any object that is used, exposed to the elements or is handled by humans with any sort of regularity. Specifically, patina on antique firearms occurs on the exterior and isÂ commonly seen on antique firearms. Patina is important because it takes years and years to develop on any object, thus often validating age claims of various antiques. While patina is a simple thing to look for in an advertised antique or collector firearm, be wary. Patina CAN be faked or accelerated by soaking or dabbing various chemicals on to the surface of metals. The best way to determine whether the patina on a specific firearm is real, retouched, or forged is to have a professional appraiser or other collector review the item to ensure authenticity.<br />
<strong><em>Maker&#8217;s Marks</em></strong><br />
Not to be confused with the brand of whiskey, maker&#8217;s marks &#8211; also known as manufacturer markings or proof marks &#8211; are also key in establishing the age and authenticity of any firearm. True craftsmen and gunsmiths have always left their unique markings on any piece they create, so any firearm completely lacking in proof marks or stamping should immediately raise a red flag. These markings help establish the firearm&#8217;s country of origin, year of manufacture, materials used and potentially even the gunsmith who created the weapon.<br />
While the location of these markings will vary from item to item, there are established, well-researched markings that have stood the test of time. The National Rifle Association has a <a title="NRA Museum - Proof Markings PDF" href="http://www.nramuseum.org/media/940944/proofmarks.pdf" target="_blank">free proof markings document</a> that can be of great help in learning the basics. However, proof marks can also be altered or stamped onto a reproduction firearms in attempts to boost the item&#8217;s value. As always, if you&#8217;re not a seasoned collector your best bet to validate the authenticity of any proof or maker&#8217;s marks will be to consult an appraiser.<br />
<strong><em>Serial Numbers</em></strong><br />
Much like proof marks, serial numbers on antique firearms were used for the same purposes then as they are today. As manufacturing became more automated, serial numbers were stamped onto specific components for quality assurance and testing purposes. As with vehicles, as these firearms aged and/or were damaged, various parts may have been swapped out to ensure that the gun stayed in good working order. This can lead to a mixing of serial numbers on any given firearm. As with matching number cars, matching number firearms are quickly becoming extremely rare and forgers have taken it upon themselves to falsify serial numbers of mixed number guns to increase their potential value. Again, the best way to ensure that the serial numbers on any firearm are authentic is to have them verified by a professional appraiser or collector if you&#8217;re not 100% familiar with the process yourself.<br />
While all of the above topics will give any casual or beginning collector a solid start when it comes to checking on the authenticity of any purchase, serious collectors of high-value firearms will definitely want to ensure that a potential purchase is reviewed by an independent or auction house appraiser. These professionals dedicate their lives to knowing all of the minute differences between firearms that can greatly effect the item&#8217;s overall value. As always, if something seems to good to be true, it often is.</p>

However, there is one form of paperwork that really shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as quite a burden: a purchase agreement.<br />
We all want to believe the best in the people with which we interact, and this includes those that we buy from and sell to. But the harsh reality is that we live in a very litigious time and in a very litigious country where, often times, the only things that can save our hides are the documents we have to support one side of a story or another. Because of this, purchase agreements are a must have anytime you buy or sell an item of significant value.<br />
<em><strong>Purchase Agreement Basics</strong></em><br />
While purchase agreements don&#8217;t have to be overly complex, there are definitely a few items that you should always be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of both parties entering into the agreement</li>
<li>Item(s) being sold and any warrantees or representations, or if the item is being sold &#8216;as-is&#8217;</li>
<li>Total purchase price</li>
<li>Current location and condition of the item being sold</li>
<li>Details as to how payment will be completed &#8211; especially if there are multiple payments or payment is contingent on items like repairs, completed projects or inspections.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction of disputes</li>
<li>Signatures &#8211; including dates if possible &#8211; for all parties involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to peace of mind, purchase agreements are required a number of different scenarios. Interstate commerce requires purchase agreements to be included with any shipments. <a title="International Shipping Tips &amp; Tricks" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/12/international-shipping-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">International commerce</a> requires purchase agreements in order to pass through customs. The government also requires a purchase agreement for taxation purposes.<br />
Aside from the number of entities that require this type of paperwork, written agreements allow for both the buyer and seller to plan for a worst case scenario. While most transactions go through with little friction, planning for the worst will ensure that both parties can rest easy knowing that a plan of action is in place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a>Â and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thompson-submachine.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2144" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thompson-submachine.jpg?w=300" alt="thompson submachine" width="300" height="167" /></a>There isn&#8217;t a buyer on the planet who wouldn&#8217;t want to know the condition of a vehicle before extending an offer to a buyer, so why wouldn&#8217;t you do the same thing for a modern or collector firearm? While the condition of a vehicle may be more readily apparent, there are many nuances that a seasoned buyer will know to look for. The same can be said for firearms. Organizations like the <a href="http://www.nramuseum.org/gun-info-research/what%27s-my-gun-worth.aspx" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a> have tried to make the process a little easier for both buyers and sellers by establishing widely accepted rating scales for both modern and collector firearms. Familiarizing yourself with the scales listed below can be a big time saver, and give both buyers and sellers a realistic idea of what a firearm is worth.<br />
<strong><em>Modern Gun Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New/Perfect</strong>: This condition level looks like it&#8217;s never left the factory packaging.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: The firearm may have been used a few times, but there is zero sign of wear and tear. Wood, metal and bluing are in perfect condition except at the muzzle or any sharp edges.</li>
<li><strong>Very good</strong>: Perfect working condition, but with no noticeable wear on working components. No corrosion or pitting present.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Safe working condition. Minor wear is likely present on working components, but still no corrosion or pitting.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Safe working condition, but well worn. Replacement of some components may be needed. No rust should be present, but some minor corrosion is not uncommon at this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Antique/Collector Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory New</strong>: 100% original parts and finish. Perfect working condition inside and out.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: This level still has all the original parts and 80%+ of the original finish. Any stamping, lettering or design on wood or metal is still crisp and clear. The wood should also unmarred and the bore in great condition.</li>
<li><strong>Fine</strong>: All original parts, but with 30%+ or so of the original finishing. Letter and stamping should also still be in near perfect condition, but dings or slight scratches on wood surfaces are present.</li>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: All original parts are present, but less than 30% of the original finish remains. All metal surfaces are original and still have crisp, sharp edges. Stenciling or lettering is clear, but wood surfaces have more noticeable scratches or dings. Bore condition is also less important at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Repair or replacement of minor parts. Rust may be present, but is smooth with minimal to no pitting and possible re-bluing of the finish. Letters and numbers are legible, and scratches or dents in wood surfaces may have been refinished or repaired.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Major components may have been replaced at this level of conditioning, and minor parts may still need repairing or replacement. Light pitting is present over most of the firearm, and rust is more noticeable. Finishing has likely been cleaned vigorously or noticeably re-blued. Sharp edges have been worn down or rounded, and lettering or stencils may be partially worn away. The key is to be in decent working order, or can be made into that condition with a little effort.</li>
<li>Poor: Significant work would need to be done to bring this type of collector firearm back into working condition. Replacement and repair of both major and minor parts, significant pitting and rust, scratched surfaces, completely worn away printing and stenciling, and complete inoperability are calling cards of this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other commonly used ratings systems include the <em>Blue Book of Gun Values</em>, based on the original finish system of rating, and <em>The Standard Catalog of Firearms</em>, which uses a system similar to the NRA rating terms, but with significantly different qualifications as to which items fall into which category.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/combine.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2123" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/combine.jpg?w=300" alt="combine" width="300" height="146" /></a>Because heavy equipment is the lifeblood of any farm or ranch, buying used can yield tractors and combines that are in near new condition. Most tractor and combine owners keep their equipment in as good of condition as possible, so the secondary market is an excellent stop for anyone looking for a new addition to their work shed. While most farming implements can be simple to inspect on your own, tractors and combines specifically can be a bit more tricky. To ensure that you don&#8217;t get stuck with any hidden problems in your next buying opportunity, we&#8217;ve line up some key points of inspection that should never be ignored.<br />
<strong><em>Used Combines</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compare your the combine&#8217;s engine hours vs. separator hours. Significantly longer engine hours warrants a closer inspection of the drive train and transmission.</li>
<li>Look for signs of wear on larger belts, chains and sprockets. Excessive wear can indicate poor maintenance, or extremely hard use by the current owner.</li>
<li>Be sure to note excessive play in bearings or slots while inspecting the cleaning shoe and sieve assemblies. Did you notice any spot welds or breakage?</li>
<li>If at all possible, get the combine started and running for a bit to see if you notice and audible problems like grinding, screeching, or knocking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Used Tractors</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the frame. Has it ever been spring or repaired?</li>
<li>Inspect the hydraulic and oil lines. Leaks here are common and can be repaired somewhat easily, but problems should still be noted.</li>
<li>Gives the tires a good once over. Are they in good condition, or are they going to need replacing soon?</li>
<li>Does the cab have a ROPS (rollover protection structure), or a wide enough front-end to protect against rollovers?</li>
<li>Note any aftermarket additions that the current owner may have installed. If anything has been added, you may want to cross reference or consult with a dealer to see if those modifications can be supported.</li>
<li>Start it up and drive around the yard if it&#8217;s at all possible. You&#8217;ll get a greater sense of the transmission and drive train if you&#8217;re able to get behind the wheel. This is your chance to note any slippage or shifting issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re not able to inspect the equipment yourself, consider providing a list of must-see items to a third party inspection company like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook</a>. It&#8217;s not uncommon for owners to have inspection documents or a mechanic&#8217;s history available to potential buyers, but a third party inspector can provide photos and video from a truly neutral position. The folks at WeGoLook.com can also create custom inspections to review any additional implements or accessories beyond the main equipment.<br />
The key to purchasing any previously owned equipment is to do your homework. Investing a little time and effort into research can save you hours of frustration and headaches that come with equipment that doesn&#8217;t meet work needs.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer.Â Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

With the advent of online and remote auctions, there are now several ways for bidders to participate, and a growing number of auction types. To make choosing the right auction for your items easier, below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the most popular types of auctions, and how each style of auction works.<br />
<strong><em>On-Site and Online Live Auctions</em></strong><br />
This type of auction is likely what most people think of when they hear the word auction. Bidding takes place in real time, and is conducted either online or in person. This is also the most straight forward way to buy or sell in an auction setting, as it is simply the person who bids the highest who walks away with the item, and all participants are able to hear each bid as it comes in.<br />
<strong><em>Webcast Auctions</em></strong><br />
Similar to live on-site auctions, these types of auctions are again conducted in real time, but the auctioneer and participants are all joined together via webcast. Lots that are up for bidding are all displayed through a webcast setting, and again, the highest bidder is the one who walks away with each lot.<br />
<strong><em>Sealed Bid Auctions</em></strong><br />
There is a greater amount of secrecy associated with sealed bid auctions as participants are unaware of what their competition is bidding. Bid are submitted to the auctioneer or auction house in sealed envelopes and, as with other auctions, the participant with the highest submitted bid will be awarded the lot.<br />
<strong><em>Timed Online Auctions</em></strong><br />
Time auctions held on sites like ebay are some of the most common web-based auctions. Sometimes created with a reserve amount and sometimes not, bidders have a number of hours, day, or weeks to bid on the lot in question. The only challenge to this type of auction is for bidders to ensure they have the last and highest bid placed before the auction closes.<br />
While there is no hard and fast rule as to what types of items are best suited to each type of auction, it ultimately comes down to how quickly the auctioneer or owner wants to sell their items.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most popularly bought and sold items on the web are collectables &#8211; sports cards, coins, comic books, and many other lesser known pieces. Like any other highly specialized base of knowledge, there are those who spend years learning the intricacies of what separates top grade collectables from their inferior counterparts. While you may not have the time required to dedicate yourself fully to learning all the ins and outs of your specific hobby, the tips below can help to give you a better understanding of what certain items are viewed as higher quality than others.<br />
<strong><em>Baseball Cards</em></strong><br />
One of the more highly priced collectables sold on ebay has been a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card. While the card in and of itself is rare and valuable, there have been some that sold for a few thousand dollars, while others that sold for tens of thousands of dollars. What&#8217;s the difference? The difference lies in the condition of the card itself. A few simply marks or unintentional creases can make all the difference. For example, the card below on the left was rated as a grade 1 by <a title="Professional Sports Authenticators" href="http://www.psacard.com/Services/PSAGradingStandards" target="_blank">Professional Sports Authenticator</a>, while the other was rated as a grade 5. That four number difference in grading was also the difference between a card that sells for $6,000, and one that sells for over $25,000.<br />

<a href='https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/buying-collectables-online-know-your-grading/attachment/20150602141215/'><img width="150" height="150" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150602141215-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<a href='https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/buying-collectables-online-know-your-grading/attachment/20150602141310/'><img width="150" height="150" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150602141310-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<br />
<strong><em>Coins</em></strong><br />
Similar to the rating scale that PSA has established for sports cards, the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation has created its own rating system to evaluate coins. Based on a scale from 1 to 70, subtle dents of marks on the coin can make the difference between one that is valued at a few dollars, or a few thousand. You can also <a title="NGC Coin Grading Process" href="http://www.ngccoin.com/coin-grading/grading-process/index.aspx#video" target="_blank">watch a video on NGC&#8217;s website</a> to get a better idea of the entire process that goes into grading various types of coins.<br />
<strong><em>Toys and Action Figures</em></strong><br />
An increasingly larger community of collectors have circled back to their childhood and turned the buying and selling of older toys and action figures into big business. This increased interest from collectors has spawned the creation of the <a title="Action Figure Authority Ratings" href="http://www.toygrader.com/grading_information.aspx" target="_blank">Action Figure Authority</a>, a grading and rating authority that specializes just in action figures and other toys. This grading association has established four specific authorities that are further specialized in their areas of expertise &#8211; the Action Figure Authority, Collectable Doll Authority, Die-Cast Authority and Video Game Authority. Each of these authorities will rate any given piece on a scale of 1 to 10, with half and quarter grades being assigned for numbers 7.5 and above.<br />
Regardless of which avenue your favorite hobbies or interests may run, the key to knowing how to buy and sell online is knowledge. While you may not have the time to learn all of the intricacies of your specific interests, knowing the basics of how those items are rated and evaluated is the first step in ensuring that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard as you seek out that perfect find.</p>

While November and December are obvious months when online shoppers should keep their guard up, in recent years there has been a significant uptick in financial and identity theft attempts around Valentine&#8217;s Day as well. Following the simple tips below can help to ensure that your Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping around the web doesn&#8217;t end in financial heartbreak.<br />
<strong><em>Be Wary of Dating Sites</em></strong><br />
Those looking for love are often feeling a little extra lonely this time of year. Scammers know this as well, and will often take advantage of those that are maybe a little too desperate to find that perfect someone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with someone through an online dating website, take the same pause that you would when shopping for a high dollar item like a classic car or luxury watch. As you communicate with the other person, a definite red flag should be an avoidance of conversation anywhere other than via email. While it&#8217;s prudent to be cautious when communicating with strangers on the web, it&#8217;s also odd to not eventually move that conversation to the phone, or even in-person.<br />
<strong><em>Phishing Scams</em></strong><br />
Similar to the routines run by criminals during the holiday season, many scammers will send out emails dressed in the guise of an online retailer or shipping company. If you receive an email that just doesn&#8217;t look quite right, or comes from an email address you don&#8217;t recognize, NEVER click on any embedded links. Many browsers will allow you to preview any hyperlinked text by simply scrolling over the text. Before you click, look toward the bottom left-hand site of your browser window to see where that link will send you.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Fall Too Fast</em></strong><br />
Love at first site is always possible, but be cautious if anyone on a dating website professes love right out of the gate. We all hope that that perfect someone is out there, but if something seems too good to be true it probably is. These claims of love are often followed by a deep desire to visit the other party in person, but they&#8217;re unable to due to financial hardship. Scammers will then ask their targets to wire money directly, or send a personal check so that they can then make the trip to visit. Of course, that trip never happens, and the target is out whatever funds were sent.<br />
Nobody wants to assume that every chance at love could be someone simply trying to scam them out of money, but taking the time to pause and reflect on any &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; scenario this time of year is a smart move.<br />
