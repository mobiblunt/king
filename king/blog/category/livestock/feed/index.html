								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/cow-closeup.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image alignright" id="i-1471" alt="Image" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/cow-closeup.jpg?w=414" width="414" height="275" /></a>The internet is bringing together cattle buyers and sellers from across the country and the globe as well.  No longer is your distribution network limited by your local sales barn or the state fair. Producers as demanding high pricing for the cattle that meet higher standards of genetics or quality.  Buyers also want to <a title="Private Treaty Livestock Sales with PaySAFE Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/livestock-escrow" target="_blank">purchase livestock</a> for their seed stock program or restaurant.</p>
<p>Sales completed outside of auctions are referred to as Private treaty sales. Private treaty sales are negotiated directly between the buyer and seller, and are generally single transactions. But before you start a new marketing campaign based entirely around private treaty, know that direct sales have their pros and cons. Producers considering private treaty as a marketing and sales channel need to research the best practices for opening up new markets and creating an efficient workflow.<br />
<em><strong>Advantages to Private Treaty</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Seller:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Custom Marketing: The seller has significant control over presentation of their livestock. Sellers can point out positive aspects of livestock and talk up the outstanding features of their animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Showcase Quality/Breed:  Showcase your herd’s genetics, origin and/or unique characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Expanded Markets: Attracting a large audience to spur buyer competition is the burden of the prospective seller when using private treaty. Print advertisements or trade associations and trade papers, word of mouth, internet marketing, media, and other promotional efforts may be needed to attract customers and capture their attention and drive sales. Buyer contact lists should be maintained for follow-up with customers to generate repeat business and positive word of mouth about customer’s experiences with the operation.  Customer service reps may also be needed for answering phone calls from prospective customers and returning emails with additional information in a timely and correct manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Creating a reputable Brand: Over time private treaty sales help producers build the reputations of their operations. Buyers not only view the livestock, but they also get to see the facilities and other aspects of the operation to get a more complete picture of the operation. Open conversations allow sellers and buyers to develop valuable and long-term business relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Custom Terms: Private treaty allows sellers to be flexible in creating a sales contract that meets everyone&#8217;s needs. A private treaty transaction can have any terms and conditions as long as both parties agree. The buyer can negotiate certain specifications, and the seller has the option of passing up a customer who is not willing to agree to certain terms in the hopes of a later buyer doing so. The seller has even more leverage in this process when the product is unique and in high demand. Under these circumstances, premiums can be realized. Those premiums can be worth it if other traditional broker fees are nonexistent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Beef Origin:  Private treaty sales allow for the acquisition of cattle directly from a ranch. Cattle purchased straight from the ranch may undergo less stress and disease exposure than cattle shipped to third-party feedlots or other intermediaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Beef Quality: The buyer can visit the ranch or  ask questions of the seller directly to learn about the herd’s health, nutrition, and other management practices used with a group of cattle so that better decisions can be made on how to transition and manage the cattle on the buyer’s operation after the sale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pricing: The buyer and seller can use information from their discussions to better arrive at a fair market price, because more information is potentially transferred with the cattle. Although other marketing channels may provide commonly requested information about cattle for sale, private treaty sales allow for direct conversations between the seller and buyer with the opportunity to exchange additional, specific information about each grouping. Basically, the buyer can ask detailed questions about the cattle, and the seller has a chance to share detailed information to add value and address any buyer concerns.<br />
<strong><em>Drawbacks to Private Treaty</em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are different business aspects of Private treaty sales that may not make them the transaction choice for every buyer or seller. For best results, people entering into private treaty sales need to have sound marketing knowledge about the ideal audience for their stock. Parties should also know the current market conditions, prices and qualities of competing cattle. Understanding the positives and negatives of their competition, they then need to determine fair market values for their cattle. This often requires a detailed knowledge of genetics, conformation, and disposition for each animal. Your herd management program information should be readily available for buyers to assess.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Negotiation skills:  Both parties in private treaty sales should be ready to openly discuss pricing. The buyer must have a good idea of what they want and what price consideration will be given for bulk purchasing. Private treaty sales are not publicly reported on a wide scale, so extra effort is required to determine a fair market value.  Educated buyers and sellers know the market and easily come to a fair market value when the facts come to light. How delivery and payment will be handled are other items that must be well defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Open Book dealing:  The seller should be prepared to answer any relevant questions the buyer may ask during the negotiation process as well as after the sale. Some concerns may be reasonable and legitimate, but the seller must also be ready to deal with unreasonable claims seeking to take advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Documentation and Payment:  By cutting out the auction you have also cut out the neutral third party that supplies documentation of the sale and helps transfer funds between each party. The seller need to be ready to create a purchase agreement and deliver all appropriate information for a bill of sale. Risk of payment collection by the seller and product misrepresentation is a real threat.  Services like PaySAFE Escrow, Inc. (<a href="http://www.paysafeescrow.com">www.PaySAFEescrow.com</a>) provide online escrow services to protect both parties and keep everyone honest.  The escrow company collects the full purchase price upfront, so the sale is locked in and the seller knows the money is good. The funds stay in Escrow with PaySAFE until the Buyer confirms that the sales conditions have been met. With escrow, both parties are protected and the funds are never refunded or paid to the seller without both parties approval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">All of this preparation takes careful thought and time on the parts of both the seller and the buyer.</p>
<p><em><strong>New markets = More profit</strong></em><br />
New online marketplaces are changing the aspect of livestock selling.  Every industry evolves and demands new business practices to compete.  These markets offer tremendous potential for cattlemen who are willing to invest the necessary effort into making it a profitable marketing channel for their business.</p>

However, there is one form of paperwork that really shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as quite a burden: a purchase agreement.<br />
We all want to believe the best in the people with which we interact, and this includes those that we buy from and sell to. But the harsh reality is that we live in a very litigious time and in a very litigious country where, often times, the only things that can save our hides are the documents we have to support one side of a story or another. Because of this, purchase agreements are a must have anytime you buy or sell an item of significant value.<br />
<em><strong>Purchase Agreement Basics</strong></em><br />
While purchase agreements don&#8217;t have to be overly complex, there are definitely a few items that you should always be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of both parties entering into the agreement</li>
<li>Item(s) being sold and any warrantees or representations, or if the item is being sold &#8216;as-is&#8217;</li>
<li>Total purchase price</li>
<li>Current location and condition of the item being sold</li>
<li>Details as to how payment will be completed &#8211; especially if there are multiple payments or payment is contingent on items like repairs, completed projects or inspections.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction of disputes</li>
<li>Signatures &#8211; including dates if possible &#8211; for all parties involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to peace of mind, purchase agreements are required a number of different scenarios. Interstate commerce requires purchase agreements to be included with any shipments. <a title="International Shipping Tips &amp; Tricks" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/12/international-shipping-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">International commerce</a> requires purchase agreements in order to pass through customs. The government also requires a purchase agreement for taxation purposes.<br />
Aside from the number of entities that require this type of paperwork, written agreements allow for both the buyer and seller to plan for a worst case scenario. While most transactions go through with little friction, planning for the worst will ensure that both parties can rest easy knowing that a plan of action is in place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

Online buyers also have the advantage of shopping through millions of products from the comfort of their couch or office chair. While there is tremendous opportunity for both parties, how can you safely complete a transaction with someone who many not be just across town, but across the globe? Following the tips below can help to ensure that whether you&#8217;re buying or selling, you&#8217;ll always be safe.<br />
<strong><em>Keep Things Disposable</em></strong><br />
Many online auction and classified websites have their own email system where buyers and sellers can communicate within the platform. However, not all sites offer this type of functionality. If you don&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to communicate with the other party through the host sites system, consider creating a non-specific and easily deleted email account. This allows you to keep your regular emails from family and friends separated from any communications with unknown buyers and sellers. That insulation layer can also provide protection against scammers who may try to hack your email.<br />
<strong><em>Go Beyond Email</em></strong><br />
Communication through email is incredibly convenient, but it can also provide scammers a great place to hide. If you&#8217;re comfortable, attempt a phone conversation with the other party. Not only does this allow you to establish that there is a real person on the other end of the transaction, but it can be a great way to iron out details that may not translate well in an email message.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Consider using an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow is great for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially when steep price tags are involved. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs. Buyers are also protected because funds are held securely with a neutral third party, and generally aren&#8217;t released until there is proof that the item has shipped or has even arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
It not difficult to believe that any seller will always try to present their item in the best possible light. Some sellers will take things a bit too far and attempt to conceal damaged items. While you may be tempted to take the seller at their word you should always consider an inspection. Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will setup a time for one of their lookers to visit the item you&#8217;re considering, and document the actual condition of the item. Depending on your requirements, these inspectors can even shoot video, or perform custom inspections to make sure that all of your concerns are addressed.<br />
When it call comes down to it, most people are better at recognizing a potential scam than they realize. If you ever get the feeling that something just isn&#8217;t right, or that it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. In that situation you should never feel badly about simply walking away from the deal.<br />

With each site requiring a password, it can be very tempting to simply repeat the same password often, or keep all of your passwords simple, but simple and often repeated passwords can be easy prey for hackers and online fraudsters. To ensure that your online accounts and the personal or financial information associated with each is kept safe, we&#8217;ve lined up six tips below to help keep your passwords strong.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Repeat Passwords</em></strong><br />
It may seem somewhat simple, but you should never repeat the exact same password for multiple logins. While you may want to use the same root word or number, it&#8217;s imperative that you add some unique characters to each account. Using this approach, hackers may be able to compromise a single account, but will have difficulty gaining access to other sites.<br />
<strong><em>Use Long, Sentence-Based Passwords</em></strong><br />
When most people think of passwords they think of a single word or combination of letters, but the only real limit to your passwords are character restrictions. Using an entire sentence of short phrase as your password can make your accounts extremely difficult to access for outside parties. Making the sentence extremely personal, like &#8220;I grew up in Omaha,&#8221; or &#8220;My college major was communications&#8221; can make your accounts inaccessible for anyone but you.<br />
<strong><em>Use Two-Step Verification</em></strong><br />
To add an extra layer of protection, websites like Facebook and Gmail have begun to offer two-step verification. This safety measure requires a second, non-web based verification before accounts can be access, or passwords changed. Most often, the service will send a text message with an access code to a mobile device. This way, if you aren&#8217;t the one requesting the password change, you would be notified that someone else is attempting to do so.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Easily Found Information</em></strong><br />
Many of us have a various pieces of personal information scattered around in public documents. Things like birth dates, maiden names, or names of children and relatives can be found somewhat easily by those who know where to look. Avoiding passwords based on that type of information is recommended.<br />
<strong><em>Change Passwords Regularly</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve ever worked in an office that deals with sensitive information, your IT team likely required a password change every three to six months. We recommend changing the passwords for your most sensitive personal accounts regularly as well. You can make it easy to remember by tying a password change to a regularly occurring event, like when you change your car&#8217;s air filter or after each dental visit.<br />
<strong><em>Use Pneumonic Devices</em></strong><br />
In elementary school we were all taught different tricks to help recall information that is difficult to remember off the cuff &#8211; like the order of the planets or multiplication tables. You can do the same thing when your passwords. For example, the phrase &#8220;This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8221; would translate to a password of TIWWCHNT. That nonsensical jumble of letters would be difficult for anyone to guess.<br />
While there may not be a 100% foolproof method to keep your passwords out of the hands of hackers, the six tips above can ensure that you&#8217;re on the right path to keeping your personal and financial information safe.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years phishing schemes, ransomware, and outright hacking have become extremely profitable for scammers. Because of the prevalence of online transactions both large and small, and the interconnectivity of both mobile and desktop devices, online thieves have been making a good living off of those who are unprepared. The infographic below, put together by <a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/infographics/how_hackers_earn_money" target="_blank">Kaspersky Labs</a>, shows just why there has been such a large jump in online attacks &#8211; they work.<br />
<a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cybercrimepays-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cybercrimepays-1.jpg" alt="cybercrimepays (1)" width="596" height="842" /></a><br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
One of the easiest ways to protect your finances in online transactions is to use an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. Buyers are protect as purchase funds are held with a neutral third party, and aren&#8217;t released until there&#8217;s proof that items have shipped or have even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds, and credit card chargebacks.<br />

We&#8217;ve covered several topics in this blog on <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/?s=shipping&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank">how to ship items properly</a>, and how to safely buy and sell larger items like boats and RVs, but once you&#8217;ve locked in the transaction for something like an ATV how are you going to move it around on your own? Because we continually talk about <a title="Why Buy New? The Benefits of the Secondary Market" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/08/18/why-buy-new-the-benefits-of-the-secondary-market/" target="_blank">how beneficial the secondary market can be</a>, below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of five of the top used trucks for towing large items.<br />
<strong><em>Ram 3500</em></strong><br />
Updates in recent years have made the Ram 3500 a leader when it comes to towing capacity. Sturdy frame construction and an updated transmission back up the claims from Chrysler as to the Ram&#8217;s 30,000 pound towing capacity, which should be more than enough capacity for your average weekend warrior hauling projects. The Ram&#8217;s 6.7 liter Cummins diesel will also provide more than enough power to move your boat, trailer, or fifth-wheel camper around as much as needed.<br />
<strong><em>Ford F-350</em></strong><br />
We&#8217;ve previously written about how Ford trucks seem to stand the test of time better than most, but with a towing capacity of 22,800 pounds the F-350 Super Duty is impressive in its own right. Also powered by a 6.7-liter turbodiesel, the F-350 delivers 800 lb-ft of torque &#8211; making any everyday towing job a piece of cake.<br />
<strong><em>Ford F-150</em></strong><br />
With a more everyday use intent behind its design, the F-150 is perfect for lighter work hauling. The F-150 configuration using the 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 gives drivers just over 11,000 pounds of towing capacity, which is perfect for light hauling like fishing boats, light trailers for dirt bikes or jet skis, and smaller pop-up campers. If you&#8217;re not planning to haul much beyond your weekend or cabin outdoor toys, a well-maintained F-150 will get the job done with no question.<br />
<strong><em>Chevy Silverado 3500</em></strong><br />
Between heavy duty and light hauling lies the Silverado 3500. Probably best used for hauling smaller numbers of livestock and mid-level ag and construction equipment, the Silverado 3500 sports a towing capacity of over 23,000 pounds powered by a 6.6-liter turbodiesel. If you&#8217;re planning to do some intermittent hauling of larger capacity items like loaded horse trailers or agricultural equipment, a used mid-level hauler like the Silverado 3500 will be a solid work horse for many years.<br />
Regardless of your preference for specific makes or models, it&#8217;s important to discuss with the dealership or current owner as to how the vehicle in question was used and maintained. A heavily used, but well-maintained, hauler can be a much better deal than a poorly cared for truck with low mileage. If there&#8217;s any doubt as to what you&#8217;re being told, be sure to consult an independent mechanic or third-party inspection company to confirm what you&#8217;re being told.<br />

There are many situations where a sturdy, reliable trailer can get the job done &#8211; especially if the distances are shorter and the weather is cooperative. Our friends at <a title="uShip.com" href="http://uship.com" target="_blank">uShip</a> have compiled the four smart tips listed below that you should always consider when you&#8217;re overseeing shipping via a trailer by yourself.<br />
<em><b>1. Get familiar with your hitch:</b></em> The hitch is the small piece of metal between your truck and the freight it’s pulling, so drivers need to know the ins and outs of their hitches. There are four different classes of trailer hitches, with each level having a different rating and weight threshold. Different hitches will likely vary in size as well, meaning the tow ball mounts will either increase or decrease with each class. While this isn’t new information, truckers must still resist the temptation to use a trailer that’s a different size than their hitch – even if it’s close. Remember, losing a customer’s cargo can not only impact a driver’s pockets, but others on the road as well.<br />
<em><b>2. Don’t push the weight:</b></em> A truck, a hitch and a trailer are all designed to withstand a certain amount of weight, give or take a few pounds. Though there may be a little leeway for hauling a heavy load, it’s dangerous and ill-advised to try and tow too much. Not only are you endangering others on the road, your truck and equipment may suffer as a result, which could impact business in the near future. Heavier loads take more fuel to pull, and putting extra stress on a truck’s frame will only hurt its performance in the long run. As tempting as it is to try and fit a load in one haul, if there’s just too much cargo, make time for an extra trip.<br />
<strong><em>3. Brakes are incredibly important: </em></strong>Most modern-day trailers have the necessary wiring and technology to hook up to a truck’s brake light system. However, if your truck is older and you need to buy a controller, it’s best to make a high-end investment, according to service magazine Popular Mechanics. Cheaper controllers are typically timer-based, which can cause a delay between the actual braking action and the light flashing on the attached trailer. Proportional brake controllers match the trailer brake output to the towed vehicle’s deceleration. At the end of the day, taking the safest measures possible is the best way to go. What’s more, Popular Mechanics recommends drivers adjust the gain on a trailer-brake controller. The trailer shouldn’t feel as if it’s dragging the truck’s performance down. On the other hand, the truck shouldn’t be doing all the braking work either. Striking the right balance will drastically help towing performance.<br />
<em><strong>4. Don’t be a jerk on the road:</strong></em> Hotshot deliveries are typically needed in an expedited manner, so it’s easy for drivers to try and rush to meet a specific deadline. However, regardless of what you’re towing, it’s important to not be overly aggressive. In fact, it’s best practice to give traffic a little extra cushion and brake well in advance so the cargo isn’t jarred loose. The inertia of the trailer may make it more challenging to stop suddenly, which is another thing to keep in mind. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also suggests drivers avoid passing on narrow roads or <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/problems/Equipment/towing/safety_tips.htm" target="_blank">going onto a soft shoulder</a>, the latter of which could lead to control issues.<br />

Unfortunately, when it comes to buying and selling items online, there are scam artists and fraudsters that try to cash in on people&#8217;s trusting nature. The only way to be 100% certain that what is advertised in an online classified or auction is legitimate is to have a professional lend their skills through an inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
The safest way to have a vehicle, boat, or any other advertised item inspected &#8211; aside from inspecting the item yourself &#8211; is to take advantage of the services offered by third party inspection companies like <a title="Inspections by WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a>. The main advantage of a third party inspection company is that the inspector has no skin in the game whatsoever. Inspections provided by the seller can potentially be biased, just as inspections completed by the buyer&#8217;s preferred party can be skewed as well. By removing any potential bias, third party inspectors can give the most complete and trustworthy inspections for any item on the market.<br />
<strong><em>Trust the Professionals</em></strong><br />
Another reason to ensure that you get an inspection for any item comes down to knowledge. Unless you happen to be an expert mechanic, jeweler, or gunsmith, odd are good that you simply don&#8217;t have the depth of knowledge required to complete a thorough inspection. There are some people who devote their entire careers to researching the minutia of their chosen trade, and only those individuals will be able to give you a complete assessment of many unique or rare items listed on online classifieds and auction websites.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Buying Blind</em></strong><br />
Because the internet has opened up a vast marketing for all types of goods there&#8217;s always the chance that the item your researching isn&#8217;t anywhere near your home. While the seller may provide all kinds of photos and reassurances that the ad is 100% accurate, are you willing to drop several thousand dollars on their word alone? Having a third party inspector from companies like WeGoLook.com take a visit in your stead allows you to avoid buying blind and just hoping that what shows up at your doorstep is what&#8217;s it supposed to be.<br />
<strong><em>Reliable Funds Transfer</em></strong><br />
While having an inspection is always good for the buyer, that may not be the case for the seller. As a show of good faith, considering using an online escrow service to prove your good intentions as well. Online escrow holds and verifies funds upfront and simply holds those funds with a neutral third party until you give the go ahead to transfer the funds to the seller. Buyers are protected as funds aren&#8217;t moved until the inspector verifies the item, or it has already shipped. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
When it comes to inspections it&#8217;s always smart to go with the pros. Our friends at WeGoLook.com have the reliable and trustworthy inspectors that you can rely on to provide a thorough inspection of whatever you might be looking to buy.

Be it quicker customer response times, shorter closing timelines, or overall cost savings, businesses are constantly using various tools to tweak a little bit here and there in efforts to nudge the needle just a bit higher. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> is one such tool at the disposal of any business buying and selling high dollar items &#8211; and can be especially valuable to businesses with international partners.<br />
<strong><em>Simple Workflow</em></strong><br />
Escrow companies like PaySAFE can provide a simple, easy-to-use workflow for creating and managing transactions. From the simple items like the buyer&#8217;s and seller&#8217;s names and total transaction amount to complex purchase agreements and heavy documentation, a simple workflow and history can save time and money while minimizing any potential misunderstandings. Online escrow services also do an excellent job of prompting either party when there are items that require their attention, like the approval of purchase agreements, uploading of required documentation, or approvals for the release of funds.<br />
<em><strong>Lock In Sales</strong></em><br />
Online escrow can be a great way to separate window shoppers from serious buyers. As all purchase funds are verified and held up front, sellers can rest easily knowing that the total transaction amount is held securely, and is simply awaiting the completion of their agreement. Buyers can also rest easy as funds aren&#8217;t released without their approval. This could be at the time of shipment, after arrival, or at various checkpoints throughout the process.<br />
<strong><em>International Transactions</em></strong><br />
Buying and selling between two individuals or companies across the globe can be challenging. Escrow services like PaySAFE can help ease that tension much as they do with domestic transactions. With significant cost savings over more traditional payment methods &#8211; like Letters of Credit &#8211; escrow can provide all the security with none of the hassle. Often times escrow can be the most cost effective way to on-board new partnerships, or to transact with other businesses that may not have access to large lines of credit.<br />
<strong><em>Lightning Fast</em></strong><br />
There isn&#8217;t a business out there that isn&#8217;t looking for some sort of a competitive edge, and most often that edge relies on speed. Traditional payment methods like letters of credit can easily get bogged down with paperwork and compliance issues. Escrow works much more quickly, and can often go from funding to disbursement in the matter of only a few days. Compared to the weeks, or even months that can be attached to applying for lines of credit or constructing letters of credit, escrow offers a significant advantage for businesses looking for the ability to turn on a dime.<br />
