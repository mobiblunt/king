First and foremost, if you&#8217;re looking to add some new iron to your arsenal price is always a consideration. That being said, there are some other aspects you should definitely take into consideration when looking at used equipment at farm auctions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shop Around</em></strong><br />
According to Greg Peterson, Farm Journal Media&#8217;s used-equipment expert, <a title="Machinery Pete’s 5 Tips for Buying Used Equipment" href="http://www.agweb.com/article/machinery_petes_5_tips_for_buying_used_equipment_NAA_Sara_Schafer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farm auctions often have some of the highest prices on the market</a>. Because of that, it&#8217;s important to seek out and compare prices in other arenas &#8211; consignments, dealer and online auctions for example. As Peterson points out, saving 3-5% on machinery priced at $300,000 or more can be a significant savings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read the Fine Print</em></strong><br />
From a buyer&#8217;s perspective, be sure to pay close attention to the descriptions offered by the seller or auction house. If anything seems amiss don&#8217;t be afraid to call the seller or auction house and see if they&#8217;re able to fill in the blanks. Also be sure to find out what guarantees or warranties may be attached to the equipment or if it&#8217;s being sold in &#8216;as is&#8217; condition.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inspect the Goods</em></strong><br />
Inspections can be the key when it comes to buying any used equipment. As construction and agriculture equipment can really take a beating &#8211; especially if it isn&#8217;t well maintained &#8211; a thorough pre-inspection by a certified farm equipment mechanic can be the difference between a great buy and a lemon. While the vast majority of live farm equipment auctions will start-up and put the item into action before beginning bidding, it is not uncommon at all for items to be sold with no guarantees as to condition and operation. Ritchie Bros. has a great checklist of <a title="Inspection tips: what to inspect before buying a used farm tractor" href="https://www.rbauction.com/blog/inspection-tips-what-to-inspect-before-buying-a-used-farm-tractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what you should inspect with tractors</a> specifically.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn the Language</em></strong><br />
Auctions and auctioneers have a language all their own. Do you know the difference between an absolute auction and an American auction? How about absentee bids and proxy bids? Be sure to familiarize yourself with any unfamiliar terms and check out this <a title="Auction Terminology and Definitions" href="http://www.auctionguide.com/tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of auction terms and definitions</a> for a crash course in auction terminology.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maintain Your Equipment</em></strong><br />
This may seem like a no-brainer, but performing regular maintenance and keeping your machinery in good mechanical and aesthetic condition can greatly affect the resale value. While individual preferences will vary from buyer to buyer, well maintained and cared for machinery will always fetch a more pleasing price for the seller once it hits the auction block.</p>
<p><strong><em>Protect Your Investment</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re purchasing equipment outside of an auction setting, be sure you take steps to protect your investment &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re buying/selling with an unfamiliar second party or over long distances. In those instances, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Commercial &amp; Agriculture Equipment" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow services</a> can be a great protection for both the buyer and seller to guarantee both funds and delivery of the equipment.</p>
<p><a href="/equipment/how-paysafe-works-equipment/">With PaySAFE® Escrow&#8217;s simple step-by-step process</a>, buyers can rest assured that their purchase will arrive after having submitted payment. Sellers too can be confident that purchase funds are verified up front and held securely with a neutral third party – eliminating the risk of non-payment. Farm equipment transactions done online or via auction can be risky, and you want to have the confidence that the other party is legitimate. Buyers and sellers of farm equipment trust PaySAFE® Escrow to facilitate transactions in a process that makes the transfer of assets safe, secure and simple.</p>

In a business climate where some verticals are seeing greater than <a title="Oracle B2B 2013 Survey" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cx/entry/2013_b2b_commerce_survey_insight" target="_blank">50% of their revenue generated from online sales</a>, how can businesses and online marketplaces even begin to separate the ready and qualified buyers from those who are just window shopping or are still in the research phase?<br />
When it comes to facilitating connections between buyers and sellers, online marketplaces would do well to provide services that allow sellers to quickly eliminate non-committed buyers from the funnel. Not only will this make closing listings easier for the seller, but the website will gain reputation as being THE place to close sales.<br />
One of the easiest ways businesses and marketplaces can help vet potential buyers is by partnering with an online escrow service. While many consumers often only associate escrow with real estate, B2B sales teams and individuals are quickly recognizing the benefits escrow provides for any type of high-dollar transaction.<br />
In its most basic function, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">escrow services</a> simply provide a neutral, third party to oversee the transfer of funds between any buyers or sellers &#8211; with increased benefit when neither party is familiar with the other. But outside of simply transferring funds, escrow services verify and hold a buyer&#8217;s funds early on in the process.<br />
The long and short of it, only serious buyers in your online marketplace will bother with escrow services. Because escrow requires the buyer to wire the full purchase amount in advance, sellers know that they can count on reliable leads.<br />
How does this benefit your business? No longer is your sales team chasing down every single inquiry that lands in their inbox. By partnering with an escrow service, the vast majority of the leads generated will only be coming from genuinely interested buyers with readily available funds.

As opportunities have opened up for small and mid-sized businesses to become larger players in their respective industries, the old approaches to payment and credit have not evolved at the same pace. Below, we&#8217;ll explore some of the long-standing types of payment systems still in place and how they stack up when compared with <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow services</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Open Credit<br />
</span></em></strong>This type of payment process is great for long-standing business relationships where the time spent underwriting the requesting party can be justified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers typically have 30, 60 or 90 days to clear outstanding balances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Good for consistent, repeat business between two parties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Underwriting for another party is time consuming and requires a knowledgeable staff to execute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Not often smart for first-time business transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses with questionable credit can be denied open lines of credit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Open lines require accounts receivable attention and can be viewed as negative credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Long term spot rates for foreign currencies is often required as transaction can take months to close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Cash-In-Advance</em></strong><br />
Just like it sounds, this type of payment is much more secure for the seller than the buyer as all the purchase funds are transferred before the purchased goods arrive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Sellers have all purchase funds up front</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Funds are out of the buyer’s account almost immediately &#8211; eliminates the need to monitor open credit lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Transferred funds are completely out of the buyer’s hands leaving that business to simply rely on purchase agreements to guarantee arrival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Burden is now entirely on the seller to execute the agreement in a timely manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Requires a larger amount of liquid assets to be available for buyers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Letters of Credit</strong></em><br />
A longstanding form of payment, <a title="Letters of Credit on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_of_credit" target="_blank">Letters of Credit</a> are a double-edged sword for both parties when it comes to B2B transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The buyer has the full good standing of the bank behind their offer of payment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Bank acts as an intermediary between two unknown parties and can assist in settling disputes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Letters of Credit can be costly &#8211; fees are often in the area of 2% of the total transaction amount and are collected from both parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Fees associated with Letters of Credit can often make them cost prohibitive for transactions of less than $50,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Modifications to terms may also cause disruption in the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Discrepancies in documents sent by the seller can potentially cause the issuing bank to void the document entirely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Escrow</em></strong><br />
<a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Escrow services</a> tend to offer a more balanced approach when it comes to security for both the buyer and the seller in addition to shorter closing periods.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Buyer’s funds are verified up front and held by a neutral party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">No underwriting is required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Partial payments or refunds are easily executed as needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Little to no attention required from accounts receivable teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Spot rate for transactions only needs to be estimated for 24-48 hours from time of payment request to payment deposit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>While not as intensive as open credit, escrow does require some monitoring by both parties to ensure that any documentation or approval deadlines are met.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a number of the above options have great applicability for specific types of transactions, escrow is really the only category that has the flexibility and cost benefits to work quickly and efficiently for both long-standing and new business relationships.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/computer-piggy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image alignright" id="i-1455" alt="Image" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/computer-piggy.jpg?w=320" width="320" height="205" /></a>When it comes to transferring large sums of money from one account to another there are a number of options. Traditionally, there&#8217;s your good ol&#8217; checkbook, but checks can bounce, be rejected for insufficient funds or even be lost outright. Cashiers checks carry many of the same risks as traditional checks in addition to the concern surrounding the fact that funds are already pulled from your account. Sending cash through the mail can be even riskier still.<br />
To avoid the security concerns attached to checks and cash, ACH (automated clearing house) transfers and wires are really the way to go when you&#8217;re moving more than a few hundred dollars between accounts. But what&#8217;s the difference between an ACH and a wire transfer?<br />
<strong><em>ACH Transfers:</em></strong><br />
Automated clearing house payments operate similarly to a traditional check, but without the risk of a paper check itself. An ACH, in its simplest terms, is just a digital transfer of funds directly from one bank account to another. The process generally takes 2-3 business days and transfers are subject to traditional banking operation hours. For example, an ACH payment that is placed after 3pm on a Thursday will likely not show in the payee&#8217;s account until Monday.<br />
The main benefit behind ACH payments are their secure nature. As no paper check exists, funds are simply transferred via a secure data line between the originating bank, the clearing house and the deposit bank. Banks also charge a significantly smaller fee for ACH transfers &#8211; generally only a couple of dollars &#8211; when compared to wire transfers.<br />
<strong><em>Wire Transfers:</em></strong><br />
Wire transfers operate very similarly to ACH payments with a few exceptions. While a wire is still sent digitally through a secure data line, funds from a wire transfer act more like a cashiers check. While ACH payments take 2-3 days to process, wire transfers are available at the close of the business day on which they are sent. Because the funds are available almost in realtime, banks generally will charge a higher fee to process a wire transfer &#8211; often in the neighborhood of $20. However, if you&#8217;re on a tight deadline that extra fee is generally worth it to have sent funds available almost immediately.<br />
Regardless of the method you choose to have your funds transferred, it&#8217;s important to remember to do your homework on where money is being sent. <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> are a great way to ensure that your electronically transferred funds don&#8217;t simply disappear into thin air when dealing with an unknown seller.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing it Yourself is a big trend in home remodeling but beware of your limitations; some projects may need to be done by a professional. <a href="http://www.moneytalksnews.com/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">MoneyTalksNews</span></a> offers advice on six things to consider when determining if your project is a do-it-yourself job or not.<br />
<strong>1. Does the project demand extensive knowledge or skill?</strong><br />
<strong>2. If I mess up, will it be noticeable?</strong><br />
<strong>3. Will I need special tools to complete the project?</strong><br />
<strong>4. Will the savings be worth not having it done professionally?</strong><br />
<strong>5. What would a professional recommend?</strong><br />
<strong>6. Am I putting myself in danger by DIY?</strong><br />
Hiring a contractor can save you time and money and piece of mind here are some tips from <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.angieslist.com/">Angie’s List</a> </span> for Making Hiring Decisions:<br />
• Call at least 3 contractors for estimates and check references, credit history and business standing.<br />
• Ask about licensing. Make sure the contractor is properly licensed for the job they will perform.<br />
• If your home was built before 1978, confirm that they are meet the EPA’s new lead paint certification requirements.<br />
• Get estimates in writing. Documentation is often the best ammunition you have if things go wrong.<br />
• Beware contractors who give you only a PO Box or answering service as contact.<br />
• Clearly communicate the updates/repairs you want done. A rough idea on paper is better than nothing.<br />
After you choose your contractor make sure and use <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/contractor-escrow">PaySAFE</a> escrow services to draw up your plans and contract agreement. <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/contractor-escrow">PaySAFE</a>  makes home improvement projects stress free by providing financial protection and better communication between contractor and home owner.  Benefits for all parties include:<br />
<strong>As a Homeowner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NEVER prepay an unknown Contractor before he has done any work!</li>
<li>Confidence that the project is completed to your satisfaction before the Contractor gets paid</li>
<li>Ability to access PaySAFE online 24/7 to view progress photos and plans</li>
<li style="display:inline!important;"></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>As a Contractor</strong>
<ul>
<li>Receive financial commitment upfront so you do not have to worry about invoicing, past due payments, NSF checks or Bad debt</li>
<li>Ability to request partial payments as the project hit milestones allowing you to make payable on time</li>
<li>Demonstrate your Integrity to complete the job successfully</li>
<li>All communication through the site is tracked as a part of the communication history for disputes</li>
</ul>
</li>

<div>Gunning for Father-of-the-Year? Yearning to frolic with family and friends in your own backyard pool?  Here&#8217;s some details to consider while making this generous gift to your family.</div>
<div>First talk to neighbors and friends who have swimming pools for information and recommendations about pool companies and builders.  You should then get in touch with several pool companies and contractors and then go check out the pools they have installed. Call on local home builders or architects for references to pool companies.  Also, check with Better Business Bureau or <a href="http://www.angieslist.com/">www.angieslist.com</a> to learn of the reliability of the builders you are considering.</div>
<div>You want to be sure that your builder is properly licensed and can make any necessary site and soil evaluations of your property. The builder also should know about existing zoning, building and grading requirements. Local building regulations should be thoroughly reviewed and understood in advance. Your discussions should be frank and a clear understanding reached before work begins so that you know what repairs will be made and who will pay for them.  Be sure to ask the builder about any liability and compensation insurance he may carry to protect you in the event of an accident during construction of the pool.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Once these considerations have been made use <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/"><b>www.</b><b>paysafeescrow.com</b></a> as an online escrow service <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/">PaySAFE<sup>®</sup></a> provides both the contractor and the homeowner a convenient location to create, negotiate and close contracts with financial protection.  The contract you sign with your builder can be the most important step in building a swimming pool. It should provide specific information about the pool you are going to have built.  The National Swimming Pool Institute points out that every item of expense for materials and labor, including optional equipment, should be covered in the contract. In your PaySAFE<sup>®</sup> contract is the date the work will start and when work is to be completed, as well as the total cost. Make certain that all promises and representations made to you orally are included in your PaySAFE<sup>®</sup> contract.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This promises to be the hap-hap-happiest family summer ever and you most certainly ARE a family man.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many homeowners must deal with the damage and cleanup following a natural disaster. So-called &#8220;fly-by-night&#8221; contractors often use these trying times as the perfect opportunity to take advantage of distraught homeowners. Appearing in communities right after a disaster occurs, the aim of fly-by-night contractors is profiting from the losses of their unsuspecting customers. They often do this by collecting up-front deposits from customers and moving on to the next town before the work is completed or, in some cases, even started.<br />
So to avoid being overcharged for shoddy work (or no work at all), it&#8217;s best to not rush into any decision &#8212; only use a contractor you trust or one who is recommended by a friend or neighbor. When you do find a contractor, be sure to use PaySAFE to ensure there&#8217;s transparency for both you and the contractor during the entire duration of the job.<br />
Here&#8217;s a list of things to avoid when hiring a contractor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Door-to-door solicitations.</strong> Licensed contractors will have all the work they can handle in the midst of a disaster and will have no need to solicit door-to-door.</li>
<li><strong>Advance payment.</strong> Always avoid paying for the entire project in advance (even with a licensed contractor). Instead, pay in installments, making sure payment is in synch with the work being done.</li>
<li><strong>No physical address.</strong> It&#8217;s common for unlicensed contractors to only offer a cell phone number. If they don&#8217;t have a physical address, it means there&#8217;s nowhere to show up to and complain (or serve a lawsuit) if things should go wrong.</li>
<li><strong>No references.</strong> If the contractor refuses to offer up references, you should refuse to work with them. Also, be sure to do a background check and contact any references they do offer to make sure they are legitimate and trustworthy.</li>
<li><strong>No contract.</strong> Never hire a contractor without a contract. Instead, get as much information as possible written in the contract, including start and completion dates, payment penalties for missed completion dates, an itemized materials list and warranty information.</li>
<li><strong>Cost too good to be true.</strong> Oftentimes fly-by-night contractors attempt to scam customers by offering extremely low prices for their work. But, as the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t sign over an insurance check.</strong> Fly-by-night contractors know that there&#8217;s plenty of insurance money floating around disaster areas. Still, you should never sign over your insurance check if they ask you to. Don&#8217;t take our word for it; the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/recovery/consumer_info.html#contractor">Federal Trade Commission suggests the same advice</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use PaySAFE.</strong> PaySAFE acts as a do-it-yourself closing table that provides trust and integrity to both you and the contractor, ensuring payment is only be exchanged once the details of the transaction are completed and approved by both parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any more questions or concerns about fly-by-night contractors, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ContractorCop" target="_blank">National Center for the Prevention of Home Improvement Fraud (NCPHIF) Facebook page</a> is a great resource.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Angie&#8217;s List published a <a href="http://www.angieslist.com/articles/3-common-contractor-scams-and-how-avoid-them.htm?CID=Social09122012ContractorGraphic" target="_blank">great infographic</a> earlier this month that offers advice on how to avoid three common types of contractor scams. According to the Census Bureau, Americans spend $33 billion on home improvements and $135 billion on home maintenance each year. Much of this work is provided by independent contractors, who in most cases are trustworthy business people, but in other cases (<a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/the-problem-solver/2009/11/contractor-sued-for-not-fulfilling-home-improvement-contracts.html" target="_blank">such as this one</a>) are not.<br />
PaySAFE acts as a do-it-yourself closing table that holds both parties accountable for a contracting transaction. Using PaySAFE ensures the money will only be exchanged once the details of the transaction are completed and approved by both parties. We offer the tools and you do the work; our paperwork-free online tools are free and easy to use and act as a neutral third party which provides transparency during the entire transaction.<br />
For more information on how PaySAFE can work for your next major home improvement project, check out our <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/construction/welcome" target="_blank">How it Works</a> section of our website.<br />
Here&#8217;s a rundown of the three common contracting scams and how to avoid them (via Angie&#8217;s List):<br />
<strong>Scam 1: &#8220;Pay up and hope that I show up&#8221;</strong> &#8212; It&#8217;s common practice for a contractor to ask for a down payment to begin the job, as it will help them buy the necessary materials to complete the work. However, when a contractor asks for a large sum of money upfront (one-third or more of the total cost), it should raise concern. In the worst scenario, the so-called contractor will eagerly collect your check, quickly deposit it and never show up again. Angie&#8217;s List also notes how 75% of contractors are willing to negotiate the down payment terms.<br />
<strong>Scam 2: &#8220;Bait and switch&#8221;</strong> &#8212; Be extremely cautious once a contractor suddenly raises the cost of the job after the contract is signed. Sure, sometimes this is a legitimate scenario (e.g., a recent spike in the cost of building materials) but oftentimes it&#8217;s simply the contractor taking advantage of the homeowner. To avoid bait-and-switch situations Angie&#8217;s List says it&#8217;s key to get as much information as possible written in the contract, including start and completion dates, payment penalties for missed completion dates and an itemized materials list and warranty information. Oh, and <strong>BE SURE</strong> you read the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> contract before signing it.<br />
<strong>Scam 3: &#8220;What paperwork?&#8221;</strong> &#8212; Unlicensed contractors often are cheaper, but bring with them several other issues that can cost the homeowner in the end. So be sure to only work with licensed contractors, demanding that they procure the necessary building permits before they start the job. Also, ask to see a certificate of insurance and call to verify it. This can save you in the end if someone is injured on the job on your private property. Contractor license requirements vary state by state and city by city, so being familiar with the local laws is a definite plus.</p>
