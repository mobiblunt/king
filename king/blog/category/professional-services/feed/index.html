How can you tell the legitimate, time-tested shippers from the less reliable, or downright irresponsible, companies that are listed online? The three tips below can help guide you through the process of picking a reliable shipping company, and ensure that you aren&#8217;t stuck with unexpected expenses or inconveniences.<br />
<strong><em>Confirm the Carrier&#8217;s Liability</em></strong><br />
Any reliable vehicle shipper will have liability insurance. The real question to ask is what that carrier&#8217;s limit of liability is &#8211; including any deductibles. Most reputable carriers will have $50,000-$100,000 in coverage, but if you&#8217;re shipping a classic or high-value car you&#8217;ll likely want to ensure that your carrier of choice carries a liability limit up to $250,000.<br />
<strong><em>Have a Realistic Timeline</em></strong><br />
Shipping for larger items like cars and trucks can be tricky. If you have very specific requirements of your shipper there may not be many shipping vehicles of that type on the road at any given time. The more specific your requests, the longer the timeline will likely be. Even basic cross country shipping can take up to a week depending on weather, driver regulations, and busier than normal shipping seasons.<br />
<strong><em>Compare Pricing</em></strong><br />
It may seem like one of the most basic things to discuss, but asking around for price comparisons is a must. Depending on the requirements you have of the shipper there can be wide variances in pricing from shipper to shipper. It&#8217;s also never a bad idea to let the shipping companies know that you&#8217;re shopping around on price. Like many other businesses, competitors will often price match or try to beat reasonable price differences.<br />
While requirements will vary from one shipping scenario to the next, the three items above should be discussed any time you&#8217;re in the need of long distance shipping. For more information on shipping high-value and unique items over long distances, see our posts on <a title="Shipping Antique &amp; Collectable Firearms" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/04/08/shipping-antique-collectable-firearms/">shipping antique and collectable firearms</a>, <a title="How To: Shipping A Vehicle Overseas" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/03/18/how-to-shipping-a-vehicle-overseas/">how to ship a vehicle overseas</a>, and <a title="Shipping Heavy Machinery Internationally" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/03/20/shipping-heavy-machinery-internationally/">shipping machinery and equipment internationally</a>.</p>

In a business climate where some verticals are seeing greater than <a title="Oracle B2B 2013 Survey" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cx/entry/2013_b2b_commerce_survey_insight" target="_blank">50% of their revenue generated from online sales</a>, how can businesses and online marketplaces even begin to separate the ready and qualified buyers from those who are just window shopping or are still in the research phase?<br />
When it comes to facilitating connections between buyers and sellers, online marketplaces would do well to provide services that allow sellers to quickly eliminate non-committed buyers from the funnel. Not only will this make closing listings easier for the seller, but the website will gain reputation as being THE place to close sales.<br />
One of the easiest ways businesses and marketplaces can help vet potential buyers is by partnering with an online escrow service. While many consumers often only associate escrow with real estate, B2B sales teams and individuals are quickly recognizing the benefits escrow provides for any type of high-dollar transaction.<br />
In its most basic function, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">escrow services</a> simply provide a neutral, third party to oversee the transfer of funds between any buyers or sellers &#8211; with increased benefit when neither party is familiar with the other. But outside of simply transferring funds, escrow services verify and hold a buyer&#8217;s funds early on in the process.<br />
The long and short of it, only serious buyers in your online marketplace will bother with escrow services. Because escrow requires the buyer to wire the full purchase amount in advance, sellers know that they can count on reliable leads.<br />
How does this benefit your business? No longer is your sales team chasing down every single inquiry that lands in their inbox. By partnering with an escrow service, the vast majority of the leads generated will only be coming from genuinely interested buyers with readily available funds. For more on how escrow and be of benefit for your business be sure to see this post on the <a title="Benefits of Escrow in B2B Transactions" href="http://wp.me/p2GdK4-pg" target="_blank">benefits of escrow in B2B transactions</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/computer-piggy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image alignright" id="i-1455" alt="Image" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/computer-piggy.jpg?w=320" width="320" height="205" /></a>When it comes to transferring large sums of money from one account to another there are a number of options. Traditionally, there&#8217;s your good ol&#8217; checkbook, but checks can bounce, be rejected for insufficient funds or even be lost outright. Cashiers checks carry many of the same risks as traditional checks in addition to the concern surrounding the fact that funds are already pulled from your account. Sending cash through the mail can be even riskier still.<br />
To avoid the security concerns attached to checks and cash, ACH (automated clearing house) transfers and wires are really the way to go when you&#8217;re moving more than a few hundred dollars between accounts. But what&#8217;s the difference between an ACH and a wire transfer?<br />
<strong><em>ACH Transfers:</em></strong><br />
Automated clearing house payments operate similarly to a traditional check, but without the risk of a paper check itself. An ACH, in its simplest terms, is just a digital transfer of funds directly from one bank account to another. The process generally takes 2-3 business days and transfers are subject to traditional banking operation hours. For example, an ACH payment that is placed after 3pm on a Thursday will likely not show in the payee&#8217;s account until Monday.<br />
The main benefit behind ACH payments are their secure nature. As no paper check exists, funds are simply transferred via a secure data line between the originating bank, the clearing house and the deposit bank. Banks also charge a significantly smaller fee for ACH transfers &#8211; generally only a couple of dollars &#8211; when compared to wire transfers.<br />
<strong><em>Wire Transfers:</em></strong><br />
Wire transfers operate very similarly to ACH payments with a few exceptions. While a wire is still sent digitally through a secure data line, funds from a wire transfer act more like a cashiers check. While ACH payments take 2-3 days to process, wire transfers are available at the close of the business day on which they are sent. Because the funds are available almost in realtime, banks generally will charge a higher fee to process a wire transfer &#8211; often in the neighborhood of $20. However, if you&#8217;re on a tight deadline that extra fee is generally worth it to have sent funds available almost immediately.<br />
Regardless of the method you choose to have your funds transferred, it&#8217;s important to remember to do your homework on where money is being sent. <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> are a great way to ensure that your electronically transferred funds don&#8217;t simply disappear into thin air when dealing with an unknown seller.<br />

Some of the world&#8217;s greatest masterpieces like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel were <a title="Commissioned Art on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_(art)" target="_blank">commissioned art</a> projects. Even today, artwork is commissioned for a wide variety of reasons. Perhaps the greater portion of commissioned art is what is called work-for-hire in the language of intellectual property. This means that an artist is employed by an individual to create art for a specific purpose. The terms of that employment usually dictate that the employer owns all rights to the work created.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Artists need to get a clear understanding of what the client wants and expects and be upfront about you are able to do. Remember that producing a work of art on commission for another party is a relationship and the key to successfully working on commission is your ability to be flexible and communicate with whomever hires you.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A commission relationship only succeeds when you respond effectively to the other party&#8217;s concerns, requests, and needs. Checkout <a href="http://www.caku-art.com" target="_blank">this blog</a> which outlines some realistic terms and expectations when entering into a commissioned project. It&#8217;s also smart to use a neutral, third-party online escrow service like <a title="PaySAFEescrow.com" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal/welcome">paysafeescrow.com</a> to create a safe and secure contract that will please all parties. These types of platforms provide buyers and sellers  with a convenient one-stop location to create, negotiate and close trades with financial protection. Online escrow services also allow the artist and client to set a timeline, be clear about how the work will be picked up, shipped, and who is liable for damage.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an independent software vendor or developer, there&#8217;s always the risk that you won&#8217;t get paid for your hard work. The circumstances behind this are many, but it usually comes down to one of a few things &#8212; lack of trust, funds and/or transparency between you and your customer. You can avoid these situations with PaySAFE. By providing free, easy-to-use online tools, PaySAFE gives both you and your customer a mutual sense of trust and integrity to build on, leading to better communication, timely completion of software and fewer disputes.<br />
<strong>Make a detailed contract</strong><br />
Making a detailed contract, or software development agreement, is critical in not only ensuring you get paid, but also in laying out the expectations between you and your customer. In the contract, it&#8217;s best to get your customer&#8217;s financial commitment upfront. Once this is in writing, move on to the finer details, including things like customer expectations of work, date of completion and payment schedule.<br />
<strong>Payment schedule</strong><br />
The payment schedule often depends on the type of software you&#8217;re developing and how long it will take to complete. If you&#8217;re working alone or are the head of a small company, scheduling payments monthly or, for example, on the completion of project milestones can give necessary funding as work progresses &#8212; just be sure to put all payment details in the contract.<br />
<strong>Work for hire vs. independent contractor</strong><br />
It should also be laid out in the contract whether the customer is hiring you as an employee (i.e., &#8220;work for hire&#8221;) or as an independent contractor. As a contractor, you own all the code as well as the final piece of software you develop, wheres as an employee the customer owns all code/software.<br />
<strong>The PaySAFE way</strong><br />
With PaySAFE, it&#8217;s easy for you and the customer to track the progress of the project with our free online communication tools, which allows the uploading of supporting documents (such as the contract). It&#8217;s also a simple way to share any updates you might have with the customer (and vice versa). All this information is stored on PaySAFE&#8217;s servers and is held as a permanent record of the sale. In the end, it&#8217;s a win/win scenario for the you and your customer because PaySAFE only releases funds once it&#8217;s agreed upon by both parties that the project is complete.<br />
Not only does PaySAFE work for software vendors and developers, but also for visual artists, writers, web designers and others independently selling their creative services.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like when exchanging other types of goods and services, artists often feel they&#8217;re at the mercy of the buyer when it comes to receiving a full, timely payment for their hard work. Oftentimes, as is the nature of creative work, the exact specifications of what the buyer expects of a commissioned piece doesn’t always match up perfectly with the output of the artist. It’s situations like these where the free online tools provided by PaySAFE can help, making sure there&#8217;s transparency between buyer and artist throughout the entire process. By providing both parties trust they can build on, PaySAFE leads to better communication, timely delivery of artwork (or other creative service) and fewer disputes, all the while promoting the integrity of both buyer and artist.<br />
When selling a commissioned artwork, make sure to do the following:<br />
<strong>Make a detailed contract</strong><br />
The more detailed the contract, the better. Make sure to include things like expectations (the size/length, style, subject matter, etc., if applicable), date of completion and a payment schedule. The contract is where you also need to address questions like: &#8220;Does this project require an advance?&#8221; &#8220;Is the advance refundable if the buyer backs out?&#8221; &#8220;Is there a third party, such as a gallery, that requires a commission?&#8221; &#8220;Who&#8217;s paying for the shipping of the finished work?&#8221;<br />
With PaySAFE’s, it’s easy to upload digital files of any supporting documents, photos and delivery terms of the transaction between artist and buyer.<br />
<strong>Good communication leads to transparency</strong><br />
In most cases, the better the buyer and artist are at communicating with one another, the more likely both parties will be happy in the end. That’s another benefit of using PaySAFE &#8212; our online communication platform makes staying in contact simple for both parties. And with a stored record of all communication, it will be easier to resolve a dispute, if one should arise.<br />
<strong>The PaySAFE way</strong><br />
Not only do these suggestions apply to visual artists such as painters, illustrators and graphic designers, but also other artists selling their creative services, like writers, fashion designers, web designers, songwriters, photographers, et al. Using PaySAFE as a trusted neutral third party will give both artist and buyer peace of mind that the transaction will be completed only upon the approval of both parties.<br />
