While November and December are obvious months when online shoppers should keep their guard up, in recent years there has been a significant uptick in financial and identity theft attempts around Valentine&#8217;s Day as well. Following the simple tips below can help to ensure that your Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping around the web doesn&#8217;t end in financial heartbreak.<br />
<strong><em>Be Wary of Dating Sites</em></strong><br />
Those looking for love are often feeling a little extra lonely this time of year. Scammers know this as well, and will often take advantage of those that are maybe a little too desperate to find that perfect someone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with someone through an online dating website, take the same pause that you would when shopping for a high dollar item like a classic car or luxury watch. As you communicate with the other person, a definite red flag should be an avoidance of conversation anywhere other than via email. While it&#8217;s prudent to be cautious when communicating with strangers on the web, it&#8217;s also odd to not eventually move that conversation to the phone, or even in-person.<br />
<strong><em>Phishing Scams</em></strong><br />
Similar to the routines run by criminals during the holiday season, many scammers will send out emails dressed in the guise of an online retailer or shipping company. If you receive an email that just doesn&#8217;t look quite right, or comes from an email address you don&#8217;t recognize, NEVER click on any embedded links. Many browsers will allow you to preview any hyperlinked text by simply scrolling over the text. Before you click, look toward the bottom left-hand site of your browser window to see where that link will send you.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Fall Too Fast</em></strong><br />
Love at first site is always possible, but be cautious if anyone on a dating website professes love right out of the gate. We all hope that that perfect someone is out there, but if something seems too good to be true it probably is. These claims of love are often followed by a deep desire to visit the other party in person, but they&#8217;re unable to due to financial hardship. Scammers will then ask their targets to wire money directly, or send a personal check so that they can then make the trip to visit. Of course, that trip never happens, and the target is out whatever funds were sent.<br />
Nobody wants to assume that every chance at love could be someone simply trying to scam them out of money, but taking the time to pause and reflect on any &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; scenario this time of year is a smart move.<br />

Online buyers also have the advantage of shopping through millions of products from the comfort of their couch or office chair. While there is tremendous opportunity for both parties, how can you safely complete a transaction with someone who many not be just across town, but across the globe? Following the tips below can help to ensure that whether you&#8217;re buying or selling, you&#8217;ll always be safe.<br />
<strong><em>Keep Things Disposable</em></strong><br />
Many online auction and classified websites have their own email system where buyers and sellers can communicate within the platform. However, not all sites offer this type of functionality. If you don&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to communicate with the other party through the host sites system, consider creating a non-specific and easily deleted email account. This allows you to keep your regular emails from family and friends separated from any communications with unknown buyers and sellers. That insulation layer can also provide protection against scammers who may try to hack your email.<br />
<strong><em>Go Beyond Email</em></strong><br />
Communication through email is incredibly convenient, but it can also provide scammers a great place to hide. If you&#8217;re comfortable, attempt a phone conversation with the other party. Not only does this allow you to establish that there is a real person on the other end of the transaction, but it can be a great way to iron out details that may not translate well in an email message.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Consider using an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow is great for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially when steep price tags are involved. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs. Buyers are also protected because funds are held securely with a neutral third party, and generally aren&#8217;t released until there is proof that the item has shipped or has even arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
It not difficult to believe that any seller will always try to present their item in the best possible light. Some sellers will take things a bit too far and attempt to conceal damaged items. While you may be tempted to take the seller at their word you should always consider an inspection. Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will setup a time for one of their lookers to visit the item you&#8217;re considering, and document the actual condition of the item. Depending on your requirements, these inspectors can even shoot video, or perform custom inspections to make sure that all of your concerns are addressed.<br />
When it call comes down to it, most people are better at recognizing a potential scam than they realize. If you ever get the feeling that something just isn&#8217;t right, or that it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. In that situation you should never feel badly about simply walking away from the deal.<br />

With each site requiring a password, it can be very tempting to simply repeat the same password often, or keep all of your passwords simple, but simple and often repeated passwords can be easy prey for hackers and online fraudsters. To ensure that your online accounts and the personal or financial information associated with each is kept safe, we&#8217;ve lined up six tips below to help keep your passwords strong.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Repeat Passwords</em></strong><br />
It may seem somewhat simple, but you should never repeat the exact same password for multiple logins. While you may want to use the same root word or number, it&#8217;s imperative that you add some unique characters to each account. Using this approach, hackers may be able to compromise a single account, but will have difficulty gaining access to other sites.<br />
<strong><em>Use Long, Sentence-Based Passwords</em></strong><br />
When most people think of passwords they think of a single word or combination of letters, but the only real limit to your passwords are character restrictions. Using an entire sentence of short phrase as your password can make your accounts extremely difficult to access for outside parties. Making the sentence extremely personal, like &#8220;I grew up in Omaha,&#8221; or &#8220;My college major was communications&#8221; can make your accounts inaccessible for anyone but you.<br />
<strong><em>Use Two-Step Verification</em></strong><br />
To add an extra layer of protection, websites like Facebook and Gmail have begun to offer two-step verification. This safety measure requires a second, non-web based verification before accounts can be access, or passwords changed. Most often, the service will send a text message with an access code to a mobile device. This way, if you aren&#8217;t the one requesting the password change, you would be notified that someone else is attempting to do so.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Easily Found Information</em></strong><br />
Many of us have a various pieces of personal information scattered around in public documents. Things like birth dates, maiden names, or names of children and relatives can be found somewhat easily by those who know where to look. Avoiding passwords based on that type of information is recommended.<br />
<strong><em>Change Passwords Regularly</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve ever worked in an office that deals with sensitive information, your IT team likely required a password change every three to six months. We recommend changing the passwords for your most sensitive personal accounts regularly as well. You can make it easy to remember by tying a password change to a regularly occurring event, like when you change your car&#8217;s air filter or after each dental visit.<br />
<strong><em>Use Pneumonic Devices</em></strong><br />
In elementary school we were all taught different tricks to help recall information that is difficult to remember off the cuff &#8211; like the order of the planets or multiplication tables. You can do the same thing when your passwords. For example, the phrase &#8220;This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8221; would translate to a password of TIWWCHNT. That nonsensical jumble of letters would be difficult for anyone to guess.<br />
While there may not be a 100% foolproof method to keep your passwords out of the hands of hackers, the six tips above can ensure that you&#8217;re on the right path to keeping your personal and financial information safe.

Scammers have found a few systems that are the equivalent of &#8220;golden oldies&#8221; that work more often than not. By reading up on some of the most common types of online scams listed below you can be confident that you&#8217;re in the know, and can head off risky situations before it&#8217;s too late.<br />
<strong><em>Non-Delivery or Non-Payment Scams</em></strong><br />
One of the most common scenarios fraudsters will use is also the simplest &#8211; they simply don&#8217;t send the money or goods. The easiest way to protect against these types of scams is to use an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> like PaySAFE. With escrow, funds are held with a neutral third party until there is proof that the item has shipped or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all funds are verified and held in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment.<br />
<strong><em>Advance Fee Fraud</em></strong><br />
Most commonly executed via email, these scams will ask the recipient to wire funds or mail a check as an advance on any item of value. This could be for potential prize winnings, cars or trucks, or supposed lump sums of cash from long lost relatives. The rub is that there is no item of value for the recipient to receive, and any money sent to the scammer will be lost and gone forever.<br />
<strong><em>Overpayment Fraud</em></strong><br />
Seen frequently on online auction and classified sites like ebay or Craigslist, overpayment fraud starts with a supposed interested buyer winning and auction or making an offer on your classified listing. The fraudster will then mail a check for payment, but has accidentally written the check for too much money and would like the seller to simply wire back the overage. Being a goodhearted seller, you gladly wire back the overpayment only to find that, by the time the buyer&#8217;s check clears, there were no funds actually in the buyer&#8217;s account. You&#8217;re now out the merchandise you sold and however much the overage was for.<br />
<strong><em>Law Enforcement Scams</em></strong><br />
Another common email scam, the sender will pose as a law enforcement officer and let you know that they&#8217;ve found a significant sum of money that you&#8217;re entitled to. The biggest tip off that these emails are scams is generally the email address of the sender. Official members of any law enforcement officer acting on behalf of their agency will not be sending messages from yahoo, hotmail, or gmail email addresses. When in doubt, look for email addresses that end with @____.gov. It&#8217;s also smart to call the agency mentioned in the message and ask to speak to the person who sent you the supposed email.<br />
<strong><em>Hacked Email Scams</em></strong><br />
Recently there has been an uptick in scams originating from email accounts that have been compromised by hackers. These hackers will commandeer an unsuspecting person&#8217;s email account, and then send messages to a few contacts within the account claiming to have been mugged while on vacation. The scammers will then ask you to wire them a little cash to get them through until their credit/debit cards are reactivated. When in doubt, try to contact your friend directly, or that friend&#8217;s spouse or other relative.<br />
Avoiding online scams can be easier than you think. Taking a minute to pause when you receive a questionable email, or making a short phone call to a respective agency or friend to confirm a message can be all it takes to save yourself both time and hassle. And remember, when it seems to good to be true it probably is.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1956" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady.jpg?w=300" alt="Frustrated Woman at Computer With Stack of Paper" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady.jpg 500w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There&#8217;s nothing worse than that moment of realization when you know you&#8217;ve been taken advantage of. Unfortunately, most of us will likely fall victim to some sort of online scam in our lifetime. Be it an errant click of a pop-up banner or a Craigslist poster selling imaginary goods, scams come in all shapes and sizes. But once you realize you&#8217;ve become a victim how can you attempt to minimize the damage?<br />
<strong><em>Call Your Credit Card Company and Bank</em></strong><br />
Priority one is to stop any potential abuse of your credit or bank accounts by scammers. If you suspect or know that you&#8217;ve fallen victim, contact your financial institution&#8217;s customer service or fraud line immediately so that they can begin monitoring your accounts. Depending on the severity of the scam, you may even need to cancel your credit/debit cards completely and start over from scratch.<br />
<strong><em>Gather Records</em></strong><br />
Stop any further communication with the potential fraudster and start gathering up all the information you can. Email addresses, phone numbers, names, descriptions of the goods they attempting to buy or sell &#8211; all of these pieces of the puzzle can help law enforcement begin to track any potential scammers. Depending on the nature of the scam, you may also need this information to share with financial institutions or insurance companies should you be able to recover any goods or funds.<br />
<strong><em>File a Police Report</em></strong><br />
Due to the proliferation of online scam and fraud, many police departments have a cyber or internet crimes specialist. Major credit agencies and most banks will also want a copy of a police report for their records as well. Unless the scammer is directly threatening you or another individual DO NOT CALL 911. Simply call the non-emergency number for your local police department and ask to speak to someone who handles internet or cyber crimes.<br />
<strong><em>Consider a &#8220;Credit Freeze&#8221;</em></strong><br />
In addition to <a title="ConsumerFinance.gov - Credit Assistance" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1375/i-may-have-been-victim-fraud-or-identity-theft-how-can-i-put-fraud-alert-my-credit-report.html" target="_blank">filing a victim fraud report with the three major credit bureaus</a>, you may also want to consider a credit freeze. Used mostly in conjunction with identity theft, a credit freeze will stop any unauthorized individuals from opening new credit accounts in your name. When speaking with each respective credit bureau, they will provide you with a personal identification number (PIN) that will be required whenever anyone attempts to open a new credit account in your name. Unless the person has that unique PIN no new accounts can be opened.<br />
<strong><em>File a Complaint with the IC3</em></strong><br />
The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a central database created by the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center that is accessible to all local, regional and federal law enforcement agencies. <a title="Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">Filing a report with IC3</a> can help alert authorities of the type of scam you have experienced, and potentially compile and compare your situation against others that may have experienced a similar scam.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Future Online Activities</em></strong><br />
In the future, consider an <a title="Prevent Fraud with PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>, like PaySAFE, to help remove the risk of fraud. Online escrow companies act as a neutral third party to hold funds when buyers and sellers are relative unknowns to each other. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are protected as all funds are verified and securely held with the escrow company &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />

Nearly 25% of all the fraud and scam reports that the NCL received in 2013 were related to check fraud &#8211; nearly all following the pattern of asking sellers to refund a supposed &#8216;accidental&#8217; overpayment. To avoid becoming another statistic in another fraud report, follow the simple steps below to protect yourself.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
When buying or selling with an unfamiliar second party you have to protect yourself first and foremost. The easiest way to do so is through the use of an online escrow company. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies like PaySAFE simply act as a neutral third party to verify and hold purchase funds. Sellers are protected as all funds are verified upfront and out of the buyer&#8217;s wallet &#8211; completely removing the risk of fraudulent checks, non-payment, insufficient funds or credit card chargebacks. Buyers are protected as well as funds are released to the seller until there&#8217;s proof of shipping, or the item has arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Be Leery of Overpayment</em></strong><br />
The most common check fraud scenario involves an &#8216;accidental&#8217; overpayment on the part of the buyer. The buyer then asks that you wire them the overage via MoneyGram or another money transmitter. In the meantime, your bank is still verifying the buyer&#8217;s funds only to find out that there is no money in the checking account it&#8217;s attempting to draw from. Now you&#8217;re out whatever money was wired back for the overage and have also likely shipped original the item(s) up for sale.<br />
<strong><em>Wait for Checks to Clear</em></strong><br />
If a buyer insists on paying by check, be sure to let them know that you&#8217;ll be waiting for the funds to clear before sending the items you&#8217;re selling. While the deposited check amount may show as &#8220;available&#8221; soon after you get it to the bank, this is simply money front to you by the bank while their team works to verify the check itself. Checks in an amount of under $5,000 generally take a day or two to be verified, whereas checks over $5,000 have a longer holding period and can take up to a week to completely clear into your account.<br />
When all is said and done, the risk of being defrauded by check comes down to using some good ol&#8217; common sense. Why would someone offer to pay more than the asking price of an item if it&#8217;s not being sold in an auction setting? Why would they simply not tear up the check for an incorrect amount and rewrite another? Often times when something seems to good to be true, it is.<br />

While there has been much discussion over the last 12 months or so regarding what Alibaba&#8217;s IPO would mean for ecommerce companies in the U.S., a number of other outlets have also taken a look at one of Alibaba&#8217;s subsidiaries &#8211; Alipay &#8211; that has integrated escrow into the backbone of its payment services. But before we get into what that integration of <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> could mean for other ecommerce payment methods, let&#8217;s take a look at the four main companies that comprise the Alibaba group.<br />
<strong>AliPay</strong> &#8211; AliPay is the number one method of payment for online goods in China. Essentially a copycat of PayPal, Alipay&#8217;s major differentiation is that it offers an escrow service &#8211; unlike PayPay &#8211; as a means to boost confidence in its platform for buyers and seller looking to enter into a new market.<br />
<strong>Alibaba.com</strong> &#8211; This is the Alibaba group&#8217;s B2B powerhouse. The site connects manufacturers direct to purchases for any myriad of products, and is the largest business-to-business platform in the world with over 7 million retailers.<br />
<strong>TMall</strong> &#8211; Essentially a way for retailers to sell direct to consumers, TMall has been the site used to introduce major like Nike and Apple to the Chinese market. The most similar business operated here in the U.S. would be Amazon with its brand-specific storefronts.<br />
<strong>Taobao</strong> &#8211; An online auction site similar to eBay, Taobao is the C2C arm of the Alibaba group. With auctions that allow for reserve prices and regular bidding, this consumer-to-consumer juggernaut uses Alipay as its payment platform of choice.<br />
<strong><em>So What Does Alibaba&#8217;s IPO Mean?</em></strong><br />
Last year alone, Alibaba&#8217;s group of companies transacted nearly $300 billion in goods &#8211; more than the entire U.S. ecommerce segment processed for 2013. Aside from the fact that Alibaba group&#8217;s IPO was also the largest in NYSE history, the company&#8217;s entrance into a U.S. exchange could signify an interest in expanding their business footprint beyond China&#8217;s borders.<br />
Should AliPay also begin to establish itself in western markets it could also mean the buoying of escrow to a more prominent place among other payment methods &#8211; a process now sometimes seen as an afterthought despite the fact that escrow offers exceptional financial protections for online transactions as compared to current payment methods. To truly compete on an even playing field, it would be great to see another online payment processor, like PayPal, integrate escrow to the same level that AliPay has. As they say, a rising tide raises all ships, and lifting U.S.-based escrow companies to a more prominent level would help both payment processors and consumers alike.<br />
The easiest way for ecommerce companies to protect themselves against a potential onslaught of competition from Alibaba&#8217;s four major sites would be to mimic the offerings of those sites just as Alibaba has mimicked other successful .coms. Look no further than 11 Main, the first site the Alibaba group has launched geared for a western market, for an example of how their teams are beginning to shape storefronts. To take a page from Alibaba&#8217;s playbook, U.S. ecommerce retailers could simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on a way to connect manufacturers and purchasers</li>
<li>Offer secure and reliable payment methods</li>
<li>Consider adding escrow as an accepted and/or preferred method of payment</li>
<li>Make international transactions easier to complete</li>
<li>Keep a strong consumer focus</li>
</ul>
<p>With the five tactics mentioned above, any advantage offered through one or all of the Alibaba-owned sites is negated. While the Alibaba group is no tame kitten, the elements of business in which they excel are all easily attainable for other web-based businesses with talented dev teams, or access to agile and capable partnerships.</p>
