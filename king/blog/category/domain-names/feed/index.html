However, there is one form of paperwork that really shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as quite a burden: a purchase agreement.<br />
We all want to believe the best in the people with which we interact, and this includes those that we buy from and sell to. But the harsh reality is that we live in a very litigious time and in a very litigious country where, often times, the only things that can save our hides are the documents we have to support one side of a story or another. Because of this, purchase agreements are a must have anytime you buy or sell an item of significant value.<br />
<em><strong>Purchase Agreement Basics</strong></em><br />
While purchase agreements don&#8217;t have to be overly complex, there are definitely a few items that you should always be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of both parties entering into the agreement</li>
<li>Item(s) being sold and any warrantees or representations, or if the item is being sold &#8216;as-is&#8217;</li>
<li>Total purchase price</li>
<li>Current location and condition of the item being sold</li>
<li>Details as to how payment will be completed &#8211; especially if there are multiple payments or payment is contingent on items like repairs, completed projects or inspections.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction of disputes</li>
<li>Signatures &#8211; including dates if possible &#8211; for all parties involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to peace of mind, purchase agreements are required a number of different scenarios. Interstate commerce requires purchase agreements to be included with any shipments. <a title="International Shipping Tips &amp; Tricks" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/12/international-shipping-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">International commerce</a> requires purchase agreements in order to pass through customs. The government also requires a purchase agreement for taxation purposes.<br />
Aside from the number of entities that require this type of paperwork, written agreements allow for both the buyer and seller to plan for a worst case scenario. While most transactions go through with little friction, planning for the worst will ensure that both parties can rest easy knowing that a plan of action is in place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a> and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

The internet has placed infinite resources at our fingertips and opened up massive person-to-person marketplaces for buying and selling anything under the sun. Even still, there are some situations where using a broker can be advantageous for buying and selling online.<br />
<strong><em>Short on Time</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s true that you can find nearly anything you would like on online classified sites or auctions, but do you have the time to dedicate to your search? Hard-to-find items can take weeks track down and often require knowledge of niche markets. Unless you happen to have access to those types of marketplaces, a broker can be a great alternative. Brokers have taken years to develop the relationships and connections needed to find buyers and sellers for highly specialized or rare items.<br />
<strong><em>Save the Paperwork</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve found the car or artwork you&#8217;re looking for you now have to draft up the proper paperwork to complete the transaction and ensure that you have the correct documentation. Again, brokers can save you time and hassle as they put together these types of deals on a regular basis &#8211; gathering all the paperwork together for you and the other party into one single portfolio.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Brokers will often work with an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other financial entity to ensure that the transfer of funds is safe and secure. Brokers that work with a platform like PaySAFE have the ability to compile the purchase agreement and any additional documentation or photos into a single interface for both the buyer and seller to view. PaySAFE then coordinates with the broker to ensure that all funds are verified and held before the seller ships the item, and that the buyer has proof of shipping or confirms delivery before their purchase funds are deposited directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice.<br />
Ultimately, the decision as to whether or not you would like to use a broker comes down to personal preference. Some buyers and sellers enjoy coordinating all aspects of a transaction on their own and have the time to do so. But if you&#8217;re a busy individual in search of a highly specialized or rare item, looking into the services of a broker may be a great alternative.<br />

Everyone gets together, items come up for bid, bidders raise their paddles or placards to indicate they would like to bid, winner bidder pays and everyone goes home happy. But do online auctions operate in the same manner? Like any hobby or business practice, there are those who push the boundaries and will try to take advantage to get an inside track or an extra buck, so what should you look out for at both in-person and online auctions?<br />
<strong><em>Low-Balled Prices</em></strong><br />
Both online and in-person auctions will sometimes intentionally low ball their prices. Knowing that the item(s) in question will be highly sought after, the auction house or private seller will intentionally place the reserve price significantly lower than it should be. This tactic will often drive a considerable uptick in interest for the item and can create a hot bed for potential bidders. More bidders = more bids, which drives the auction item quickly above and beyond the original reserve price.<br />
<strong><em>Shills</em></strong><br />
Shills are a group of sellers or individuals who have decided to work together to drive up the prices of certain items. Simply put, one person puts and item up for bid and a few others will drive up the price by placing empty bids until an unsuspecting party comes in to the equation. Once the legitimate bidder places a bid topping the others, the seller&#8217;s partners drop out of the bidding and leave the genuine bidder holding the bag. Running shills in prohibited in most auction houses, but online it can be much more difficult to detect when or if there are shills running in the background. The easiest way to avoid being taken is to simply set your own personal limit on the item, and to walk away if bidding passes that dollar amount. It can be tough to let that dream purchase go, but it&#8217;s better than being stuck paying for an overpriced item.<br />
<strong><em>Trust Your Eyes</em></strong><br />
Many people are drawn to auctions by brand names. Luxury brands draw in bidders who are seeking luxury brand names, but with auctions you can sometimes find amazing deals if you&#8217;re willing to look past the brand. Sometimes in-person auctions will have a separate section with lower priced goods. While these items won&#8217;t draw the crowds, you can easily find quality among the lesser known designers and brands. Do a little research of your own on some unfamiliar or non-household brand names and you could be rewarded with great quality at an even better price point.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Find out if the auction you&#8217;re participating in will allow you to pay via an online escrow service. <a title="PaySAFE Online Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> protects both the buyer and the seller by verifying and hold purchase funds with a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds are only released when there is proof that the item has shipped or has arrived at its final destination. Sellers and auction houses are protected as all purchase funds are verified upfront &#8211; eliminating the risk of insufficient funds, fraudulent checks, and credit card chargebacks.<br />
Sometimes the best protection you can have in any auction setting is to trust your gut and set ground rules for yourself. If you know exactly how much you want or can afford to spend, going above that limit should happen in only rare circumstances. Trusting your gut is also important. Often times if a deal or situation seems too good to be true, it usually is.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/computer-piggy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image alignright" id="i-1455" alt="Image" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/computer-piggy.jpg?w=320" width="320" height="205" /></a>When it comes to transferring large sums of money from one account to another there are a number of options. Traditionally, there&#8217;s your good ol&#8217; checkbook, but checks can bounce, be rejected for insufficient funds or even be lost outright. Cashiers checks carry many of the same risks as traditional checks in addition to the concern surrounding the fact that funds are already pulled from your account. Sending cash through the mail can be even riskier still.<br />
To avoid the security concerns attached to checks and cash, ACH (automated clearing house) transfers and wires are really the way to go when you&#8217;re moving more than a few hundred dollars between accounts. But what&#8217;s the difference between an ACH and a wire transfer?<br />
<strong><em>ACH Transfers:</em></strong><br />
Automated clearing house payments operate similarly to a traditional check, but without the risk of a paper check itself. An ACH, in its simplest terms, is just a digital transfer of funds directly from one bank account to another. The process generally takes 2-3 business days and transfers are subject to traditional banking operation hours. For example, an ACH payment that is placed after 3pm on a Thursday will likely not show in the payee&#8217;s account until Monday.<br />
The main benefit behind ACH payments are their secure nature. As no paper check exists, funds are simply transferred via a secure data line between the originating bank, the clearing house and the deposit bank. Banks also charge a significantly smaller fee for ACH transfers &#8211; generally only a couple of dollars &#8211; when compared to wire transfers.<br />
<strong><em>Wire Transfers:</em></strong><br />
Wire transfers operate very similarly to ACH payments with a few exceptions. While a wire is still sent digitally through a secure data line, funds from a wire transfer act more like a cashiers check. While ACH payments take 2-3 days to process, wire transfers are available at the close of the business day on which they are sent. Because the funds are available almost in realtime, banks generally will charge a higher fee to process a wire transfer &#8211; often in the neighborhood of $20. However, if you&#8217;re on a tight deadline that extra fee is generally worth it to have sent funds available almost immediately.<br />
Regardless of the method you choose to have your funds transferred, it&#8217;s important to remember to do your homework on where money is being sent. <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> are a great way to ensure that your electronically transferred funds don&#8217;t simply disappear into thin air when dealing with an unknown seller.<br />

<p>PaySAFE is proud to release a Broker option for domain name brokers facilitating buying and selling of Domain Names. <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/domains/welcome?L">PaySAFE</a> online escrow service created the ability for a Broker to create the transaction details (in step 1)and identify the Buyer and Seller upfront. PaySAFE will then follow the online escrow procedures (see below) to provide financial protection and transparency to the deal.<br />
In addition to creating the transaction details for their client&#8217;s ease, the Broker will also stipulate how the purchase price will be paid out.

No more account receivable for the Broker while the buyer and seller can be assured that everyone only gets paid if the deal closes.<br />
PaySAFE allows the Broker to stay independent and never be involved with the money transfer or holding of secure financial information of the buyer or seller. PaySAFE hides this information for everyones protection.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There can be a lot of uncertainties when buying a domain name online. That&#8217;s why using PaySAFE as a trusted third party escrow service gives you peace of mind that the transaction will be completed only upon the approval of both buyer and seller. In other words, PaySAFE ensures the buyer&#8217;s name will be registered with the domain and the seller can be confident they&#8217;ll get paid in full and on time.<br />
<strong>Tips on buying a domain name with PaySAFE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify domain name ownership prior to the transaction.</strong> This makes sure the seller is who they claim to be and indeed the actual owner of the domain name. To determine this, you can use one of the various <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com" target="_blank">free Whois owner-lookup websites</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Both parties need to agree on the details.</strong> PaySAFE provides a purchase agreement that outlines the details involved in the transfer of the domain, including price, domain name and date of inspection.</li>
<li><strong>Be as transparent as possible to avoid disputes.</strong> There often can be a deadline or other important requirement tied to the transaction, so it&#8217;s vital to get all the details in writing and signed by both parties. PaySAFE&#8217;s free online tools allow the buyer and seller to upload and examine all supporting documents at any time, which can be referenced in case of a dispute.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How PaySAFE Works</strong><br />
Through an easy-to-use online project management dashboard, PaySAFE provides both parties with a clear, detailed snapshot of the domain name transaction. The buyer and seller should include as much information as possible, including supporting documents (especially, as mentioned above, those verifying the seller&#8217;s domain name ownership).<br />
Since the buyer pays PaySAFE and not the seller, PaySAFE, acting as a neutral third party, will only release payment once both the buyer and seller agree that the domain transfer is complete. Using PaySAFE leads to better communication, timely delivery of domain name and fewer disputes, all the while promoting both parties&#8217; integrity.<br />

<strong>The PaySAFE way</strong><br />
PaySAFE is an ideal way to buy and sell domains as well as other high-end goods and services. By using PaySAFE, trust and integrity always go hand in hand. If you have any questions, contact PaySAFE <a href="http://mailto:support@paysafeescrow.com/">by email</a> or by calling 402.881.7133.<br />
