However, with the increased convenience and opportunity, there’s also an increase in risk.<br />
Scams and fraud are very real concerns when it comes to making any purchase on the web. This risk increases greatly when you’re talking about transactions involving thousands of dollars and sometimes-stressful documentation. The best way to ensure that you aren’t a victim of a scam is to protect yourself from the start using an <a title="Vehicle Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">escrow service.</a><br />
An escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third-party and usually associated with high-value purchases. They can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction, including buying/selling a vehicle.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Buyers</h2>
<p>As a buyer, one of the biggest risks you run into is misrepresentation. You think you’ve found the holy grail of classic cars only to find out that, after the vehicle arrives, you’ve been taken for a ride. Escrow services help to mitigate that risk almost entirely. As a buyer, all of your purchase funds are held with a neutral third-party and are only released as specific checkpoints in your agreement are reached.<br />
So, if the seller’s vehicle arrives and isn’t what was advertised, you have the opportunity to return the vehicle to the seller and be refunded the full purchase price.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Sellers</h2>
<p>From the seller’s perspective, the greatest risk is that the buyer doesn’t pay the agreed amount. Escrow services remove that issue from the equation by verifying the funds–in full–up front. You won’t have to worry about cashier’s checks being lost in the mail or notice of insufficient funds days after your vehicle has left your driveway.<br />
Escrow also allows for the scheduling of smaller payments to be released to you, as needed, to cover things like transportation or repair costs. These scheduled payments will be outlined in the agreement.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Use an Escrow Service?</h2>
<p>Most online escrow services also include a workflow that allows for the easy uploading of any documentation required by the parties involved in the sale, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspection forms from mechanics.</li>
<li>Bills of lading.</li>
<li>Photos of the vehicle to verify condition or progress of repairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these items can be easily uploaded to bolster the seller’s claim as to the vehicle’s condition and to ease the mind of any nervous buyer. This type of record is even more important if the sale is taking place between residents of different states or countries.<br />
The best part about using an online escrow service for your vehicle purchase is having all of these services done by the one company and all in one place. Online escrow platforms allow for documentation, transportation arrangements, and purchase funds to be held securely in one easy-to-access location with a full communication history available to either party at any time.<br />
When dealing with a buyer or seller unknown to you, using an escrow service gives you the best protection.</p>

In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

Not only do you have to hone your bargaining skills as you would when working with dealer, you&#8217;ll also likely need to secure the full purchase price up front and complete some paperwork that the dealer would normally complete on your behalf. So, when you&#8217;re looking at buying a car from a private seller be sure to pay close attention to the tips below.<br />
<strong><em>Verify the Vehicle</em></strong><br />
While we often want to assume the best in others it&#8217;s important to do some background work. If you&#8217;ve already found the car you want to buy you&#8217;ll want to call and confirm that the ad is legitimate. Scams and fraudulent ads are often placed by those who only want to communicate through email. If the private seller&#8217;s phone number is listed it&#8217;s worth a quick call to confirm that there&#8217;s a real person on the other end of the line.<br />
<strong><em>Vehicle Inspection</em></strong><br />
Buying from a private seller means you&#8217;ll also need to try and secure a vehicle inspection. While the seller may swear up and down that their car is in perfect, road-ready condition, you&#8217;ll want to ensure that a neutral third party inspects the vehicle for you if you&#8217;re unable to be there in person. There are a number of vehicle inspection companies like <a title="InspectMyRide.com" href="http://inspectmyride.com">InspectMyRide.com</a> or <a title="RoadReadyCertified.com" href="http://roadreadycertified.com">RoadReadyCertified.com</a> that will send a certified inspector to the seller&#8217;s location and provide both parties with a comprehensive vehicle inspection report.<br />
<strong><em>Clear the Title</em></strong><br />
When you&#8217;re buying a car from a private seller, the responsibility falls on you to ensure that the vehicle is free of and liens or loans. While the seller should disclose this information, a simple comparison of the registration and title to the VIN will not only tell you if there is still a lien on the vehicle, but also allow you a chance to make sure all the paperwork matches up as it should.<br />
<em><strong>Paperwork Round Up</strong></em><br />
Buying a car from a private seller means that you now get to play the roll of paperwork clerk as well as the buyer. As mentioned above, you&#8217;ll need to gather a copy of the title, registration and any other supporting documentation that may be required by the state you live in &#8211; all for tax purposes.<br />
<em><strong>Protect Your Purchase with Escrow</strong></em><br />
While buying a car from a private seller can be a significant cost savings, you&#8217;ll still want to protect your purchase funds. Private sellers and buyers can both benefit by using an escrow service, which acts as a neutral third party to hold the full purchase price until the purchase agreement is completed. With escrow, the buyer&#8217;s funds are verified up front to avoid non-payment and sellers no longer have to worry about misrepresentation or mailing checks.

Regardless of how you find your dream vehicle, remember that working with a private seller, in many ways, is no different that working with a dealer. While you may not have the financing options or quantity of vehicles to choose from, a private seller is working to get as much money out of their vehicle as possible. However, arming yourself with the above tips is a great way to ensure that you have enough information in your arsenal to negotiate and close a sale like a pro.</p>
