However, with the increased convenience and opportunity, there’s also an increase in risk.<br />
Scams and fraud are very real concerns when it comes to making any purchase on the web. This risk increases greatly when you’re talking about transactions involving thousands of dollars and sometimes-stressful documentation. The best way to ensure that you aren’t a victim of a scam is to protect yourself from the start using an <a title="Vehicle Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">escrow service.</a><br />
An escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third-party and usually associated with high-value purchases. They can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction, including buying/selling a vehicle.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Buyers</h2>
<p>As a buyer, one of the biggest risks you run into is misrepresentation. You think you’ve found the holy grail of classic cars only to find out that, after the vehicle arrives, you’ve been taken for a ride. Escrow services help to mitigate that risk almost entirely. As a buyer, all of your purchase funds are held with a neutral third-party and are only released as specific checkpoints in your agreement are reached.<br />
So, if the seller’s vehicle arrives and isn’t what was advertised, you have the opportunity to return the vehicle to the seller and be refunded the full purchase price.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Sellers</h2>
<p>From the seller’s perspective, the greatest risk is that the buyer doesn’t pay the agreed amount. Escrow services remove that issue from the equation by verifying the funds–in full–up front. You won’t have to worry about cashier’s checks being lost in the mail or notice of insufficient funds days after your vehicle has left your driveway.<br />
Escrow also allows for the scheduling of smaller payments to be released to you, as needed, to cover things like transportation or repair costs. These scheduled payments will be outlined in the agreement.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Use an Escrow Service?</h2>
<p>Most online escrow services also include a workflow that allows for the easy uploading of any documentation required by the parties involved in the sale, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspection forms from mechanics.</li>
<li>Bills of lading.</li>
<li>Photos of the vehicle to verify condition or progress of repairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these items can be easily uploaded to bolster the seller’s claim as to the vehicle’s condition and to ease the mind of any nervous buyer. This type of record is even more important if the sale is taking place between residents of different states or countries.<br />
The best part about using an online escrow service for your vehicle purchase is having all of these services done by the one company and all in one place. Online escrow platforms allow for documentation, transportation arrangements, and purchase funds to be held securely in one easy-to-access location with a full communication history available to either party at any time.<br />
When dealing with a buyer or seller unknown to you, using an escrow service gives you the best protection.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to purchase a brand new vehicle. When shopping for a pre-owned car or truck it&#8217;s normal to see some wear and tear, but not every sign of regular use is detrimental to the value of a car. Because many vehicle owners take good care of their cars, used vehicles are often a good value for those needing reliable, everyday transportation. That said, the four items listed below are components that you or your chosen inspector should pay close attention to before you write a check.<br />
<strong><em>Frame Damage</em></strong><br />
Every single other component of a vehicle relies on a sturdy frame. The frame is also designed to take the brunt of any impact from a crash, so a vehicle with a robust accident history is definitely more prone to frame damage. Short of an inspection by a professional mechanic you can look down the length and width of a vehicle to see if you notice any unnatural bends or dips in the body. Any out of place curves along the sight lines of the car can also indicate potential frame damage. Record of damaging past accidents can also usually be found by running a vehicle history report.<br />
<strong><em>Leaks</em></strong><br />
Cars rely on a myriad of fluids to stay in good working order. For those fluids to do their respective jobs, you need them to stay IN the car. Before and after a test drive be sure to check for any fluid pooling under the vehicle. Regardless of the season you&#8217;ll also want to run the AC and heater to make sure that the heating and cooling systems don&#8217;t contain any hidden leaks that would otherwise stay hidden until the next shift in seasonal weather. Signs of oil, transmission fluid and antifreeze under the vehicle should also be addressed before closing any deal.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2036" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/alignment-issues.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2036 size-medium" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/alignment-issues.jpg?w=300" alt="alignment issues" width="300" height="236" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2036" class="wp-caption-text">Common alignment issues.</figcaption></figure><br />
<strong><em>Alignment</em></strong><br />
One of the easiest things to check absent of a professional inspection is steering alignment. The tires on the front of your vehicle should be completely vertical and in proper alignment to be safely operated. Toe in or toe out and negative or positive chamber leanings could be indicative of needing nothing more than needing a steering alignment, but could also point to larger issues with the vehicle as a whole. The steering wheel should also rest level during a test drive with no pulling to the left or right when driving in a straight line.<br />
<strong><em>Electrical Systems</em></strong><br />
Most vehicle owners tend to take add-ons like electric door locks and windows for granted, and can easily gloss over checking those items in an inspection. Be sure to turn everything on, check headlights and tail lights, turn on the stereo, and test out any navigation systems. Poorly functioning or quickly diminishing power in the electrical system can indicate potential problems with the car&#8217;s battery, or possibly even the alternator.<br />
<strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
In the event that you&#8217;re buying a vehicle through an online classifieds or auction site, you should definitely be using a third party inspector. Our friends at <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will send someone out to inspect the vehicle you&#8217;re interested in and do everything from a simple walk around to snap a few photos, to custom inspections that culminate in a specialized report compiled by the looker.<br />

Looking for a car or truck on auction sites like ebay is now one of the most common methods used by used car buyers. So, before you discount online listings in your next vehicle hunt, consider the three reasons below as to why more and more car buyers are moving online.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow Protection</em></strong><br />
The advent of online escrow services has made buying large ticket items online a much more secure process. <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies can now easily protect buyers by securing purchase funds in an escrow account until there&#8217;s proof that the vehicle has been shipped, or has arrived at its final destination. Buyers who use online escrow services can rest easy knowing that their funds will not be transmitted until they give the green light to do so &#8211; completely removing the need to share financial information with the second party, or send cashier checks hundreds of miles away with only the hope that the car will be shipped.<br />
<strong><em>Cast a Wide Net</em></strong><br />
The sheer number of vehicles listed on online classified sites and auction platforms is mind boggling. Even the largest used car lot in your area often has only a fraction of the vehicles listed on ebay at any given time. More choices means buyers have more options, and aren&#8217;t limited by simply what&#8217;s available at local dealerships.<br />
<strong><em>See The Total Purchase Price</em></strong><br />
With the exception of any potential shipping arrangements, the cost listed on online classified and auction sites is exactly the cost buyers can expect to pay. No hidden fees, unexpected taxes or financing fees &#8211; just the sticker price and nothing more. While buyers can always take extra steps like hiring a third party inspection company like WeGoLook.com, or specialized shipping through companies like uShip.com, online listed prices rarely include any surprise charges.<br />

From classic and antique automobiles worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to a first-time driver&#8217;s well used Honda, the web has opened up person to person trade for vehicles at an amazing pace. While there are literally tens of thousands of car classifieds across the web, not all websites are created equal. Below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the most secure and well-vetted websites for <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">buying and selling cars online</a>.<br />
<a title="Classified Car Listings with NationalVehicle" href="http://nationalvehicle.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>NationalVehicle.com</em></strong></a><br />

<a title="Classified Car Listings with AutaBuy.com" href="http://autabuy.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Autabuy.com</em></strong></a><br />

<a title="Classified Auto Listings with ebay Motors" href="http://www.ebay.com/motors" target="_blank"><strong><em>ebay Motors</em></strong></a><br />
If you&#8217;re not familiar with at least one of ebay&#8217;s vertical sites, you should be sure to dig into ebay Motors. Searching ebay&#8217;s classified auto listings is incredibly easy, and the bidding process for buyers is relatively straightforward. Sellers have numerous options when it comes to creating listings &#8211; including reserve amount, additional photo options, promoted listings and more &#8211; to help boost your listing to the exposure level you need. If you&#8217;re new to selling on sites like ebay Motors, check out our tips for selling items on sites like ebay.<br />
Regardless of the website you choose to buy or sell through, be sure that you protect your finances when it comes to the transaction itself. Online escrow services, like PaySAFE, are great options when buying or selling between two unknown parties &#8211; or those separated by large distances. Buyers can rest easy knowing that their funds are held securely with a third party until there&#8217;s proof that the vehicle has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers gain peace of mind in knowing that all funds are verified and held up front &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks or credit card chargebacks.<br />

<strong><em>Unusually Low Pricing</em></strong><br />
While this is one of the most common ways of luring in desperate buyers, it works. Scammers will list an above-average condition vehicle at a price that is significantly lower that other vehicles of the same make, model and year. Once the buyer is hooked, they&#8217;ll often partner this low-listing scam with an overpayment scam or a request for a deposit wired direct through MoneyGram or WesternUnion.<br />
<em><strong>Listings from Another Country</strong></em><br />
Again, these listings will usually have a very sound price, but with a seller who is located overseas. Often times the lister will also pair this reasonable price with an offer of free shipping from their home country. This is a GIANT red flag as overseas shipping can easily cost thousands of dollars by the time taxes and customs fees are added to the shipping cost itself.<br />
<em><strong>Look for Mentions of eBay and Other Supposed Guarantors</strong></em><br />
Craigslist has yet to partner with another ecommerce company like eBay or ClassicCars.com. However, this has not stopped scammers from trying to waylay the fears of potential victims by using the names of these reputable companies. Should you come across an ad that claims eBay or another site has guaranteed the purchase, or will cover potential losses in any way, walk away. The only listings companies like eBay may cover or offer protection for are the listings on their own websites.<br />
<em><strong>Inability to Provide Photos</strong></em><br />
Most ads on Craigslist will provide some sort of image of the car, but it&#8217;s a good idea to ask for additional photos. Many scammers will simply pull photos from listings on a legitimate website and pass them off as their own. If the lister is unable to provide additional photos, or claims to not have physical access to the vehicle to verify any inquiries you&#8217;ll want to be very cautious if you choose to proceed at all.<br />
<em><strong>Protect Yourself and Your Finances</strong></em><br />
When you&#8217;re buying or selling items online, one of the easiest ways to keep yourself from falling victim to any type of scam is to use an <a title="PaySAFE Vehicle Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE act as a neutral third party between a buyer and seller who are relative unknowns to each other. Buyers are protected as all purchase funds are held securely in escrow until the seller has provided proof that the item has shipped, or it has already arrived. Sellers are equally protected as all purchase funds are verified in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of insufficient funds, fraudulent checks or credit card chargebacks.<br />

Below we&#8217;ve compiled a checklist that any used car buyer should print out and run through prior to exchanging funds. If you&#8217;re unable to examine the vehicle in-person, be sure to check out our post about <a title="Why Get a Vehicle Inspection?" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/24/why-get-a-vehicle-inspection/" target="_blank">the importance of a third party inspection</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Prior to driving the vehicle:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the tires individually. Does each have at least a quarter of an inch of tread? Is the wear even? A good rule of thumb is to take along a penny and insert it vertically in the tread. If Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s head isn&#8217;t at least partially hidden by the tread you need to consider new tires. Also, are the tires matched in size and brand?</li>
<li>If the vehicle has wheels with spokes, look through the openings on the front wheels to check the disc brake rotors. Are they scored or rusty in any way?</li>
<li>Look under the car for fluid leaks. Do this with the engine off and again with it running. While cars may have a little collection of water if heat is excessive and the air conditioner has been running, there should be no sign of oil, anti-freeze or other lubricants.</li>
<li>Squat at the front corners of the car and look down along its sides for ripples that might indicate body repairs.</li>
<li>Open and close all the doors and the trunk. Make sure all operate smoothly. Uneven or difficult to open/close doors can be an indication of frame or chassis damage.</li>
<li>Lock and unlock all the doors from inside and out.</li>
<li>Ask the salesman or owner to sit behind the wheel and operate the headlights, brake lights and turn signals as you verify that they work. Missing or flickering lights can be an indication of electrical system issues.</li>
<li>Open the hood with the engine running and listen for knocks, ticks or hisses. Also keep an eye out for excessive vibration or shaking hoses/fluid reservoirs.</li>
<li>Check door edges and hinges for rust. This is often the first place where rust will begin to accumulate due to proximity to the road surface and any leftover salts or deicing compounds if you live in a region of the country that has harsh winters.</li>
<li>Lift up the pad or carpet in the trunk and check for rust. Rust on the interior of the vehicle is a good indicator of leaky sunroofs or windows, or possibly even flood damage.</li>
<li>Make sure the controls for every system operate properly. Does the air conditioner cool, does the heater heat, does the CD player work?</li>
<li>If there is an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror or the interior smells as though it was just sprayed with air freshener, open the doors for a few minutes and let it air out. By the time your test-drive is completed, the air freshener smell should be gone and you can get a better idea of the odors you will have to live with.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Once you&#8217;re behind the wheel:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you drive the vehicle above 60 miles per hour at some point. Many front-end problems aren&#8217;t detectible at lower speeds. Does the front end shake, shimmy or vibrate? Does the car accelerate appropriately for highway driving?</li>
<li>Does the steering wheel vibrate at any speed, or is the steering loose or sluggish when maneuvering?</li>
<li>Are there any odd noises when you accelerate from a standstill? Does the car seem to struggle or stall before going forward?</li>
<li>Does the vehicle pull to one side or the other when you accelerate? Find a large, empty parking lot. At 20 miles per hour or so, let go of the steering wheel; does the vehicle pull to one side or the other? If so, this can be an indication of alignment issues.</li>
<li>Does the transmission shift smoothly?</li>
<li>Apply the brakes; does the pedal feel squishy? Does the vehicle pull to one side or the other when braking?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, you should take two test drives before buying any used vehicle. While the first test drive allows you to make your own assessment, the second test drive should be to a qualified, third-party mechanic. If the dealer or private owner is unwilling to allow a third-party inspection it&#8217;s a good indication that this is a deal you should walk away from.</p>

But the most important piece of paperwork that any buyer should check when purchasing a car is the title. A vehicle&#8217;s title is considered &#8220;clean&#8221; if there are no liens held against it, and the car has never had a salvage or damage claim against it. If the title of the vehicle you&#8217;re considering is free of those three things, you&#8217;re good to go! Here&#8217;s how to find out if you&#8217;ve got a clean title:<br />
<strong><em>Run a Vehicle History Report</em></strong><br />
Companies like CarFax and InstaVin do a deep dive on any vehicle&#8217;s history. For a small fee, these companies will search any records available to ensure that the vehicle in question is free of any liens. The reports these companies produce will also provide a detailed history of any accidents, flood damage, etc.<br />
<strong><em>Get a Mechanic&#8217;s Opinion</em></strong><br />
If it&#8217;s at all possible, take any vehicle to a third party or trusted mechanic for a second opinion. While most sellers will be willing to provide you with some sort of documentation as to the car&#8217;s condition, it never hurts to double check &#8211; especially if you aren&#8217;t well versed in auto repair and maintenance yourself.<br />
<strong><em>Ask For the Original</em></strong><br />
If everything you&#8217;re being told by the seller checks out, simply ask to see a copy of the original title. This is your chance to make an in-person inspection of the title to ensure that there are no liens against the vehicle in question. If the seller is unwilling to show you the original title for one reason or another it should be a giant red flag, and likely a reason to be willing to walk away from the deal entirely. Without ensuring that the vehicle is free of liens you could be on the hook for any additional funds left due to the bank or financing company.<br />
If you&#8217;re unsure about the vehicle&#8217;s title it may also behoove you to use an online escrow service to secure your purchase funds. <a title="PaySAFE Vehicle Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> allows the buyer to rest securely knowing their funds are held with a neutral third party until the vehicle shows up and is as advertised. Seller&#8217;s also get the piece of mind in knowing that the purchase funds are verified, removing the risk of non-payment or insufficient funds.</p>
