When you&#8217;re dealing with power plants and components that weigh hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds traditional shipping over any long distance can prove exceptionally challenging. Throw in the additional requirements of international shipping and it&#8217;s perfectly understandable that some buyers or sellers would simply throw their hands in the air and pass on any offers coming in from overseas.<br />
However, knowing your shipping options ahead of time means buyers and sellers need not pass up on the potential cash cow that is international machinery sales. While there are definitely more steps that need to be taken, they aren&#8217;t so daunting as to avoid shipping internationally entirely.</p>
<p><strong><em>RO-RO Shipping</em></strong><br />
One of the most common methods of shipping vehicles and heavy equipment is roll on-roll off shipping, or RO-RO. Almost exactly what it sounds like, this type of overseas shipping is designed for self-propelled machinery that can be driven on and off of the transport ship on wheel, treads or tracks. While <a title="RO-RO Shipping on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RO-RO  shipping</a> is extremely common, it can also require a great deal of lead time. Space on RO-RO ships is in high demand and space for heavy machinery can be reduced or eliminated with little notice. Shipping to or from ports during a high volume season &#8211; like Japan during the rollout of a new year of vehicles &#8211; can also mean the need for flexibility on the part of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flat-Rack Shipping</em></strong><br />
For machinery and equipment that cannot be driven on or off of a vessel, flat-rack shipping is an option. Similar to being loaded onto a flat-bed truck, these open containers come in 20-40ft dimensions and can support up to 67,000 pounds. These open-style racks also come with tethers to secure machinery safely to the bed of the rack and side walls still allow for stacking once onboard the ship. If used for machinery, these types of shipping racks may require the shipper to disassemble component in order to fit within the confines of the shipping rack.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1605 alignleft" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg?w=300" alt="Freight-Container-sizes" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes.jpg 849w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freight-container-sizes-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Container Shipping</em></strong><br />
Probably the most common type of overseas shipping that comes to mind, container shipping is similar to open flat-rack shipping in dimensions and weight limits, but completely enclosed. This type of shipping method will likely require any machine to be disassembled, at least in part, and may also require more than one container to accommodate all of the components. For unusually tall machinery, open-top containers are also available as well as refrigerated containers should temperature control be an issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Select a Shipper &amp; Customs Services</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve settled on the type of shipping you need to accommodate your machinery shipment, the next step is to find a shipping and logistics company that has the experience to schedule, reserve and arrange proper documentation. It&#8217;s also important to discuss customs services with your shipping coordinator. Depending on the shipper, customs services may or may not be included in the shipping fees. You may also need to seek third party assistance for customs services if they aren&#8217;t offered through your shipper. The Federal Maritime Commission also has a listing of <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - OTI List" href="http://www2.fmc.gov/oti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">licensed international shippers</a> that can be a great help.</p>
<p><strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Now that you&#8217;ve sorted out the shipping methods best suited for your machinery, make sure you have funds for the transaction locked in as well. <a title="PaySAFE® Escrow - International Trade" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/international-trading-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online escrow services</a> are a great way to ensure that both buyer and seller are protected &#8211; especially when both parties are relative unknowns to each other. With escrow, buyers no longer need to worry about paying in advance and simply hoping their purchase shows up. Sellers also gain the advantage of knowing that purchase funds are verified up front and held securely with a neutral third party &#8211; completely eliminating the risk of non-payment. Heavy equipment transactions done online or via auction can be risky, and you want to have the confidence that the other party is legitimate. Buyers and sellers of heavy equipment trust PaySAFE® Escrow to facilitate transactions in a process that makes the transfer of assets safe, secure and simple. </p>
<p>Regardless of which shipping method you and your counterpart decide upon, never feel badly for asking additional questions. Doing some background work ahead of any potential international sale can make the process much less daunting and help to avoid any delays.</p>

While there are definite risks when it comes to international shipping, there are a few easy tips that anyone should follow when it comes to shipping any items internationally.<br />
<strong><em>Start Small</em></strong><br />
Like most skills, arranging international shipping requires practice and repetition to make sure all your i&#8217;s are dotted and t&#8217;s are crossed. The easiest way to get the hang of things is to start be shipping small, easier-to-package items. Maybe a simple gift for your niece studying abroad for a semester or a house warming gift for that friend spending a week in Tokyo. Mastering the basics with lesser-valued items can help reduce the stress and confusing when moving on to bigger ticket purchases.<br />
<em><strong>Speak the Same Language</strong></em><br />
Start by shipping between countries that share a common language. There&#8217;s no point in adding the risk of translation errors to the mix when you may not be 100% familiar with packing requirements or postage.<br />
<em><strong>Ask the Experts</strong></em><br />
Organizations like the United States Postal Service have international shipping down to a science. The USPS&#8217; <a title="USPS International Shipping How-To Guide" href="https://www.usps.com/ship/international-how-to.htm" target="_blank">International How-To Guide</a> and <a title="USPS International Addressing Tips" href="https://www.usps.com/send/international-addressing-tips.htm" target="_blank">International Addressing Tips</a> are great places to start if you&#8217;ve never shipped internationally before.<br />
With all of the information now available on the internet, international shipping isn&#8217;t nearly as daunting of a task as it once was. However, if a Google search or Facebook post doesn&#8217;t yield the answers you&#8217;re looking for, a call to your local post office can usually help clear up and issues. Happy shipping!</p>

On a day-to-day basis, tens of thousands of tons of goods move through customs at ports up and down both the Pacific and Atlantic coastlines as well as the southern ports ringing the Gulf of Mexico. But if you&#8217;re looking to <a title="Shipping Heavy Machinery Internationally" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/03/20/shipping-heavy-machinery-internationally/" target="_blank">ship heavy machinery</a> or vehicles, there are a few select ports that move far more <a title="Roll-on/Roll-off Cargo on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off" target="_blank">roll-on/roll-off (RORO)</a> cargo than others.<br />
If you happen to be on or near the East Coast you have a few RORO hubs at your disposal. Further north, Baltimore ships the lion&#8217;s share of vehicles and machinery with New York City coming in a distant second. Further south, the Florida ports of Jacksonville and Miami carry most of the RORO shipping loads &#8211; Jacksonville seeming to be the Baltimore of the South when it comes to RORO shipments. Smack in the middle of the northern and southern ports sits Charleston, South Carolina which, while significantly smaller in volume, does seem to offer a fair number of RORO shipping opportunities should larger ports not be an option for one reason or another.<br />
If you happen to be nearer to the Gulf region of the United States, Houston and Galveston, Texas handle the bulk of RORO shipments.<br />
Shifting to the Pacific side of America, we&#8217;re once again presented with a few options for <a title="How To: Shipping a Vehicle Overseas" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/03/18/how-to-shipping-a-vehicle-overseas/" target="_blank">shipping vehicles</a> or machinery out of major ports. In the north, Tacoma, Washington is a large port that handles a great deal of shipping to Alaska as well as destinations to the west like Japan and China. Southern California also boasts to large RORO shipping centers in Port Hueneme and Los Angeles.<br />
While the vehicle or machinery&#8217;s final destination will play a large role in which port will likely be responsible for shipment, work with your logistics or transportation coordinating team to ensure that you have collected all the proper documentation and materials required. Most U.S. ports will have similar documentation requests, but the destination port requirements can vary from country to country. Also bear in mind that seasonality does play a roll in RORO shipping availability. New model year launches for vehicles can be particularly busy as large numbers of newly manufactured vehicles are being both imported and exported &#8211; particularly on the west coast.<br />

While there are definitely more boxes to check when it comes to shipping vehicles internationally, there are a few easy steps you can take to make the process go more smoothly.<br />
<strong><em>Research the Laws of Both Countries</em></strong><br />
If you have an interested party from another country, be sure to read up on the import and export laws of their home country and your own. Details like the vehicle&#8217;s engine size, age and emissions are often closely regulated by both the importing and exporting country&#8217;s customs departments. You and the other party will also need to discuss who will cover the various taxes, tariffs or duties that may be associated with importing or exporting a vehicle. In the Unites States, you can consult these documents when <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - Importing a Car" href="http://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-car" target="_blank">importing a vehicle</a> or <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - Exporting a Car" href="http://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/export-docs/motor-vehicle" target="_blank">exporting a vehicle</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Work with a Licensed Moving Company</em></strong><br />
Not all transportation companies are licensed for business involving international shipping. Properly licensed companies will be registered with the Federal Maritime Commission, are well-versed in laws and regulations regarding importing and exporting vehicles, and are bonded to protect their customer&#8217;s belongings during transport. These companies can also provide customs processing services that may or may not be included in the transportation fee. Be sure to iron out the details with your transporter to find out if you may need to seek out a secondary company for customs services and the costs involved. Follow this link to <a title="Federal Maritime Commission OTI List" href="http://www2.fmc.gov/oti/" target="_blank">find out if your transportation company is licensed</a> by the FMC.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve done your homework and selected a transportation company, it&#8217;s time to protect and lock in your funds. <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Vehicle Escrow Services" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> a great method to secure purchase funds when dealing with an unknown second party. For buyers, purchase funds are held securely in escrow &#8211; helping to protect you against misrepresentation. For sellers, the buyer&#8217;s funds are verified up front and held in escrow before you ship the vehicle &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment.<br />
<strong><em>Prepare Your Vehicle</em></strong><br />
International shipping often requires the complete removal of things like gasoline or other flammable liquids before being loaded for transport. If you are planning to ship additional items with the vehicle &#8211; like vehicle parts or winter/summer tires &#8211; be sure to consult with your transport company. Many countries will not allow vehicles to enter port if they are filled with other items, so any additional components will likely need to be shipped separately from the vehicle itself.<br />
If you&#8217;ve completed all of the above steps but still have questions, never feel badly about asking for assistance. Your transportation and escrow companies often have a wealth of information and tips when it comes to their respective specialties, and the <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - Contact Us" href="http://www.fmc.gov/about/contact_us.aspx" target="_blank">Federal Maritime Commission</a> also has a 1-800 number for questions related to importing and exporting various items.</p>
