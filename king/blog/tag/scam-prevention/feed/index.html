While November and December are obvious months when online shoppers should keep their guard up, in recent years there has been a significant uptick in financial and identity theft attempts around Valentine&#8217;s Day as well. Following the simple tips below can help to ensure that your Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping around the web doesn&#8217;t end in financial heartbreak.<br />
<strong><em>Be Wary of Dating Sites</em></strong><br />
Those looking for love are often feeling a little extra lonely this time of year. Scammers know this as well, and will often take advantage of those that are maybe a little too desperate to find that perfect someone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with someone through an online dating website, take the same pause that you would when shopping for a high dollar item like a classic car or luxury watch. As you communicate with the other person, a definite red flag should be an avoidance of conversation anywhere other than via email. While it&#8217;s prudent to be cautious when communicating with strangers on the web, it&#8217;s also odd to not eventually move that conversation to the phone, or even in-person.<br />
<strong><em>Phishing Scams</em></strong><br />
Similar to the routines run by criminals during the holiday season, many scammers will send out emails dressed in the guise of an online retailer or shipping company. If you receive an email that just doesn&#8217;t look quite right, or comes from an email address you don&#8217;t recognize, NEVER click on any embedded links. Many browsers will allow you to preview any hyperlinked text by simply scrolling over the text. Before you click, look toward the bottom left-hand site of your browser window to see where that link will send you.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Fall Too Fast</em></strong><br />
Love at first site is always possible, but be cautious if anyone on a dating website professes love right out of the gate. We all hope that that perfect someone is out there, but if something seems too good to be true it probably is. These claims of love are often followed by a deep desire to visit the other party in person, but they&#8217;re unable to due to financial hardship. Scammers will then ask their targets to wire money directly, or send a personal check so that they can then make the trip to visit. Of course, that trip never happens, and the target is out whatever funds were sent.<br />
Nobody wants to assume that every chance at love could be someone simply trying to scam them out of money, but taking the time to pause and reflect on any &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; scenario this time of year is a smart move.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years phishing schemes, ransomware, and outright hacking have become extremely profitable for scammers. Because of the prevalence of online transactions both large and small, and the interconnectivity of both mobile and desktop devices, online thieves have been making a good living off of those who are unprepared. The infographic below, put together by <a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/infographics/how_hackers_earn_money" target="_blank">Kaspersky Labs</a>, shows just why there has been such a large jump in online attacks &#8211; they work.<br />
<a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cybercrimepays-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cybercrimepays-1.jpg" alt="cybercrimepays (1)" width="596" height="842" /></a><br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
One of the easiest ways to protect your finances in online transactions is to use an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. Buyers are protect as purchase funds are held with a neutral third party, and aren&#8217;t released until there&#8217;s proof that items have shipped or have even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds, and credit card chargebacks.<br />

The best parts of owning newer smartphones are the access it provides to the web and productivity apps to make everyday tasks easier. But the convenience of having access to your personal and financial information comes with added risks, specifically as it relates to scammers and phishing schemes. You can greatly mitigate those risks by following the tips below to keep your personal information safe while still having all the access you&#8217;d like on your new mobile device.<br />
<strong><em>Lock It Up</em></strong><br />
It may seem all to simple, but it&#8217;s surprising how few people will take the time to setup a simple screen lock on their new phone or tablet. Setting a numeric password or trace pattern on your device&#8217;s lock screen makes it extra difficult for your device to be accessed in the event that it&#8217;s stolen or misplaced. Without a lock screen password any and everyone can access your phone and all the information it holds.<br />
<strong><em>Turn Off Bluetooth</em></strong><br />
One of the benefits of today&#8217;s mobile devices is connectivity to household items and vehicles through Bluetooth. However, that ease of connection means that your device is continually searching for something to connect to, and scammers know that as well. Turning off Bluetooth when you know you&#8217;re not going to be connecting to any other devices can keep you safe from thieves looking to pirate your information, and it saves your batter as well.<br />
<strong><em>Setup Safeguards</em></strong><br />
Many of today&#8217;s mobile devices come equipped with safeguards in the event your devices is stolen or hijacked. Taking the five to ten minutes to activate safety features like remote access and/or remote wiping capabilities on your device can serve as an important, last ditch effort in protecting any personal or financial information stored on a mobile device that&#8217;s no longer under your control.<br />
<strong><em>Monitor Any Apps</em></strong><br />
There&#8217;s an app for almost anything under the sun. Ride sharing, mobile banking, music streaming services, online shopping &#8211; all of these apps will often give you the option to store data like credit or debit card numbers, banking account numbers and addresses in an effort to make your use of the app easier. While storing those pieces of information can definitely make using the apps easier, it can also leave that data vulnerable to potential hackers. Keeping track of the permissions you give to various apps on your phone, and not allowing any that seem questionable, can help to keep your information safe.<br />
While it&#8217;s impossible to plan for every eventuality when it comes to using a mobile device you can definitely plan ahead to mitigate any foreseeable issues. Setting a lock screen password, turning off Bluetooth when it&#8217;s not in use, and taking time to monitor your apps and setup remote access or deletion are all great ways to keep your information safe, but the best safeguard is your own intuition. If something just doesn&#8217;t seem right or seems too good to be true, it most likely is.<br />

Scammers know this as well, and this is the time of year that they hope your everyday shopper will drop their guard when it comes to fraud protection for a chance at that unbelievable holiday deal. So, as the holiday buying season approaches, we&#8217;ve compiled some of the most common scam scenarios that government and private information advocacy groups think you should watch out for.<br />
<strong><em>Free Gift Card Scam</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s not uncommon for people to comparison shop on their mobile devices. So, scammers will often mass text a bank of numbers with a &#8220;free gift card code&#8221; that potential victims would enter on a fraudulent website. Once on the fake website scammers will ask for additional information, promising a free gift card to a major retailer in exchange for private information. Of course, the gift cards don&#8217;t really exist, and the scammers now have a plethora of personal information that was unwittingly handed over by deal-crazed shoppers.<br />
<strong><em>Malicious eCards</em></strong><br />
Most of us are familiar with the &#8220;Elf Yourself&#8221; video craze that first hit the internet around 2010, but not every promise of an entertaining holiday video on Facebook or Twitter is legit. These phishing schemes will promise social media users a hilarious holiday themed video in exchange for sharing the video out to their social network. However, much like with the fake gift card scam, once the user chooses to share the video scammers simply phish personal information from the users social media account.<br />
<strong><em>Near Miss Websites</em></strong><br />
The number of queries sent to search engines on Cyber Monday is enormous. Scammers know this as well and will often construct elaborate fake websites with web addresses that use common misspellings of major brands &#8211; think BesstBuy.com instead of BestBuy.com. In search of great deals many users will mistake the fake site for a real one as the hackers behind such scams will simply mimic the content and design of the legitimate website to further confuse their victims. This type of scam is especially dangerous as many online shoppers pay only glancing attention to the address of the website on which they&#8217;re shopping.<br />
<strong><em>Take Your Time and Protect Yourself</em></strong><br />
The common scams listed above are easily preventable if you simply slow down and think. We all want to get the best pricing we can when it comes to popular items, but double checking web addresses, examining senders of emails, and recognizing when an offer is too good to be true can go a long way to keeping your financial and personal information secure during the hectic holiday season. <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is also an absolute must for those buying and selling through online classified and auctions sites.<br />

Scammers have found a few systems that are the equivalent of &#8220;golden oldies&#8221; that work more often than not. By reading up on some of the most common types of online scams listed below you can be confident that you&#8217;re in the know, and can head off risky situations before it&#8217;s too late.<br />
<strong><em>Non-Delivery or Non-Payment Scams</em></strong><br />
One of the most common scenarios fraudsters will use is also the simplest &#8211; they simply don&#8217;t send the money or goods. The easiest way to protect against these types of scams is to use an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> like PaySAFE. With escrow, funds are held with a neutral third party until there is proof that the item has shipped or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all funds are verified and held in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment.<br />
<strong><em>Advance Fee Fraud</em></strong><br />
Most commonly executed via email, these scams will ask the recipient to wire funds or mail a check as an advance on any item of value. This could be for potential prize winnings, cars or trucks, or supposed lump sums of cash from long lost relatives. The rub is that there is no item of value for the recipient to receive, and any money sent to the scammer will be lost and gone forever.<br />
<strong><em>Overpayment Fraud</em></strong><br />
Seen frequently on online auction and classified sites like ebay or Craigslist, overpayment fraud starts with a supposed interested buyer winning and auction or making an offer on your classified listing. The fraudster will then mail a check for payment, but has accidentally written the check for too much money and would like the seller to simply wire back the overage. Being a goodhearted seller, you gladly wire back the overpayment only to find that, by the time the buyer&#8217;s check clears, there were no funds actually in the buyer&#8217;s account. You&#8217;re now out the merchandise you sold and however much the overage was for.<br />
<strong><em>Law Enforcement Scams</em></strong><br />
Another common email scam, the sender will pose as a law enforcement officer and let you know that they&#8217;ve found a significant sum of money that you&#8217;re entitled to. The biggest tip off that these emails are scams is generally the email address of the sender. Official members of any law enforcement officer acting on behalf of their agency will not be sending messages from yahoo, hotmail, or gmail email addresses. When in doubt, look for email addresses that end with @____.gov. It&#8217;s also smart to call the agency mentioned in the message and ask to speak to the person who sent you the supposed email.<br />
<strong><em>Hacked Email Scams</em></strong><br />
Recently there has been an uptick in scams originating from email accounts that have been compromised by hackers. These hackers will commandeer an unsuspecting person&#8217;s email account, and then send messages to a few contacts within the account claiming to have been mugged while on vacation. The scammers will then ask you to wire them a little cash to get them through until their credit/debit cards are reactivated. When in doubt, try to contact your friend directly, or that friend&#8217;s spouse or other relative.<br />
Avoiding online scams can be easier than you think. Taking a minute to pause when you receive a questionable email, or making a short phone call to a respective agency or friend to confirm a message can be all it takes to save yourself both time and hassle. And remember, when it seems to good to be true it probably is.<br />

Unfortunately, most of us will likely fall victim to some sort of online scam in our lifetime. Be it an errant click of a pop-up banner or a Craigslist poster selling imaginary goods, scams come in all shapes and sizes. But once you realize you&#8217;ve become a victim how can you attempt to minimize the damage?<br />
<strong><em>Call Your Credit Card Company and Bank</em></strong><br />
Priority one is to stop any potential abuse of your credit or bank accounts by scammers. If you suspect or know that you&#8217;ve fallen victim, contact your financial institution&#8217;s customer service or fraud line immediately so that they can begin monitoring your accounts. Depending on the severity of the scam, you may even need to cancel your credit/debit cards completely and start over from scratch.<br />
<strong><em>Gather Records</em></strong><br />
Stop any further communication with the potential fraudster and start gathering up all the information you can. Email addresses, phone numbers, names, descriptions of the goods they attempting to buy or sell &#8211; all of these pieces of the puzzle can help law enforcement begin to track any potential scammers. Depending on the nature of the scam, you may also need this information to share with financial institutions or insurance companies should you be able to recover any goods or funds.<br />
<strong><em>File a Police Report</em></strong><br />
Due to the proliferation of online scam and fraud, many police departments have a cyber or internet crimes specialist. Major credit agencies and most banks will also want a copy of a police report for their records as well. Unless the scammer is directly threatening you or another individual DO NOT CALL 911. Simply call the non-emergency number for your local police department and ask to speak to someone who handles internet or cyber crimes.<br />
<strong><em>Consider a &#8220;Credit Freeze&#8221;</em></strong><br />
In addition to <a title="ConsumerFinance.gov - Credit Assistance" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1375/i-may-have-been-victim-fraud-or-identity-theft-how-can-i-put-fraud-alert-my-credit-report.html" target="_blank">filing a victim fraud report with the three major credit bureaus</a>, you may also want to consider a credit freeze. Used mostly in conjunction with identity theft, a credit freeze will stop any unauthorized individuals from opening new credit accounts in your name. When speaking with each respective credit bureau, they will provide you with a personal identification number (PIN) that will be required whenever anyone attempts to open a new credit account in your name. Unless the person has that unique PIN no new accounts can be opened.<br />
<strong><em>File a Complaint with the IC3</em></strong><br />
The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a central database created by the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center that is accessible to all local, regional and federal law enforcement agencies. <a title="Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">Filing a report with IC3</a> can help alert authorities of the type of scam you have experienced, and potentially compile and compare your situation against others that may have experienced a similar scam.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Future Online Activities</em></strong><br />
In the future, consider an <a title="Prevent Fraud with PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>, like PaySAFE, to help remove the risk of fraud. Online escrow companies act as a neutral third party to hold funds when buyers and sellers are relative unknowns to each other. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are protected as all funds are verified and securely held with the escrow company &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
