								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/escrow_coins_600px.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1764" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/escrow_coins_600px.jpg?w=300" alt="Escrow" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/escrow_coins_600px.jpg 600w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/escrow_coins_600px-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Fraud and online scams are an unfortunate element of buying and selling online. In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

Now comes the research and, most importantly, digging in to how much you should actually pay.<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5em;">A leader in value information,</span><a style="line-height:1.5em;" href="https://www.worthpoint.com/user2/createStep2?plan=unlimited">WorthPoint.com</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is an online resource for researching and valuing antiques, art and collectibles. WorthPoint empowers the antique and collectible industry by providing a steady stream of new data and quality information &#8211; ultimately helping improve the transparency in pricing and value between sellers and buyers.  </span><br />
<span style="line-height:1.5em;">WorthPoint offers both a do-it-yourself (DIY) model as well as access to a knowledge network of professional appraisers with expertise in numerous collecting verticals.  Their do-it-yourself model is a simple solution that gives users access to over 130 million historical prices and images. This data is aggregated from both online marketplaces and from some of the leading auction houses. Setting the right value for an item is the crucial first step in a fair and amicable agreement. Once the price and terms of your transaction are set, we recommend using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> &#8211; like PaySAFE</span><sup style="line-height:1.5em;">®</sup><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> &#8211; to make doubly sure that your dream collectable doesn&#8217;t turn into a financial nightmare.</span><br />
With a collectable and antiques marketplace that is often fraught with reproductions and outright counterfeits, doing your own background work when it comes to pricing and valuation is a must.

You deserve nice things and yet paying for these &#8220;things&#8221; can pose a problem.  Rather than build up credit card debit, save up for your large purchases.  Set a goal and then commit to saving a specific dollar amount or percentage of your income every pay period; pay yourself first because if you wait to see what&#8217;s left over, you’ll be less likely to save.  Arrange for an automatic money transfer from your paycheck to a savings account. If the money is taken out before you cash your check, chances are you won’t spend it.  A brilliant way to do this is through using <a href="http://www.smartypig.com">SmartyPig</a>.  SmartyPig is an online piggy bank for people saving for specific financial goals like a wedding, a vacation, a big screen TV, a home remodeling project, car or home. This online tool puts you in control of your own financial independence by helping you build a save-then-spend mentality. <a href="http://www.bargaineering.com/articles/r/smartypig.php?tag=review">SmartyPig</a> helps you save towards your goals by giving you a high yield interest rate AND the ability to have family and friends help you save towards your goal. When you&#8217;ve achieved it you can access it by having it transferred back to your bank, converted to a debit card, or converted to a retail gift card.  Oh the joy! You have finally saved up for that nice &#8220;thing&#8221; you have always wanted and so now so be sure to use <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com">PaySAFE</a> to safely pay out that hard saved money.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking your business Internationally can bring new opportunities and challenges!  To reduce payment risk of international transactions experts recommend using an Escrow service.  Escrow service is recognized as a viable payment technique to be used for export trade in the third edition of the U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Association&#8217;s 2012 <a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/">Trade Finance Guide</a>.<br />
Simply put escrow payment service ensures both the seller and buyer gets the intended benefits over a trade. It reduces potential risk of fraud on both party and it acts as trusted third party that collects, holds and disburses funds according to buyer and seller instructions.<br />
Online escrow services are provided by bonded escrow agents. Suited for small to large value merchandise or intellectual property where conventional payment system is either unsuitable or un-economic. Typically used for items purchased on auction sites: personal goods, domain names, vehicles, commercial goods, etc.<br />
Exporters use escrow for collecting payment from export shipments where the buyer is unwilling to pay in advance and Letter of Credit is an expensive option.<br />
It is commonly used for a first-time transaction where buyer and seller are conducting business for the first time and are unfamiliar with each other. For exporter, escrow is the safest way around avoiding chargebacks and payment fraud/scam form unknown payment sources. For importer, a credible intermediary can always help in between buyer and seller to build trust in each other.<br />
Seller is protected by escrow in a way that buyer is first required to deposit the full payment before seller ships the ordered product. Likewise, buyer is protected, since escrow will only be released once the buyer has taken delivery of the product. The buyer does the usual inspection of the product&#8217;s quality and then accepts the release of payment to seller from escrow.<br />
Escrow methods varies when buyer is not satisfied with the product, seller has no option but to replace the product as far as escrow is concerned buyer is already fully paid. The buyer&#8217;s responsibility now is to return the product to the seller with full proof of the damage, or the reason behind buyer rejected the said product.<br />
