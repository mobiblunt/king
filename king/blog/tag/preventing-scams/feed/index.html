From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

Nearly 25% of all the fraud and scam reports that the NCL received in 2013 were related to check fraud &#8211; nearly all following the pattern of asking sellers to refund a supposed &#8216;accidental&#8217; overpayment. To avoid becoming another statistic in another fraud report, follow the simple steps below to protect yourself.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
When buying or selling with an unfamiliar second party you have to protect yourself first and foremost. The easiest way to do so is through the use of an online escrow company. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies like PaySAFE simply act as a neutral third party to verify and hold purchase funds. Sellers are protected as all funds are verified upfront and out of the buyer&#8217;s wallet &#8211; completely removing the risk of fraudulent checks, non-payment, insufficient funds or credit card chargebacks. Buyers are protected as well as funds are released to the seller until there&#8217;s proof of shipping, or the item has arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Be Leery of Overpayment</em></strong><br />
The most common check fraud scenario involves an &#8216;accidental&#8217; overpayment on the part of the buyer. The buyer then asks that you wire them the overage via MoneyGram or another money transmitter. In the meantime, your bank is still verifying the buyer&#8217;s funds only to find out that there is no money in the checking account it&#8217;s attempting to draw from. Now you&#8217;re out whatever money was wired back for the overage and have also likely shipped original the item(s) up for sale.<br />
<strong><em>Wait for Checks to Clear</em></strong><br />
If a buyer insists on paying by check, be sure to let them know that you&#8217;ll be waiting for the funds to clear before sending the items you&#8217;re selling. While the deposited check amount may show as &#8220;available&#8221; soon after you get it to the bank, this is simply money front to you by the bank while their team works to verify the check itself. Checks in an amount of under $5,000 generally take a day or two to be verified, whereas checks over $5,000 have a longer holding period and can take up to a week to completely clear into your account.<br />
When all is said and done, the risk of being defrauded by check comes down to using some good ol&#8217; common sense. Why would someone offer to pay more than the asking price of an item if it&#8217;s not being sold in an auction setting? Why would they simply not tear up the check for an incorrect amount and rewrite another? Often times when something seems to good to be true, it is.<br />
