We&#8217;ve covered several topics in this blog on <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/?s=shipping&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank">how to ship items properly</a>, and how to safely buy and sell larger items like boats and RVs, but once you&#8217;ve locked in the transaction for something like an ATV how are you going to move it around on your own? Because we continually talk about <a title="Why Buy New? The Benefits of the Secondary Market" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/08/18/why-buy-new-the-benefits-of-the-secondary-market/" target="_blank">how beneficial the secondary market can be</a>, below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of five of the top used trucks for towing large items.<br />
<strong><em>Ram 3500</em></strong><br />
Updates in recent years have made the Ram 3500 a leader when it comes to towing capacity. Sturdy frame construction and an updated transmission back up the claims from Chrysler as to the Ram&#8217;s 30,000 pound towing capacity, which should be more than enough capacity for your average weekend warrior hauling projects. The Ram&#8217;s 6.7 liter Cummins diesel will also provide more than enough power to move your boat, trailer, or fifth-wheel camper around as much as needed.<br />
<strong><em>Ford F-350</em></strong><br />
We&#8217;ve previously written about how Ford trucks seem to stand the test of time better than most, but with a towing capacity of 22,800 pounds the F-350 Super Duty is impressive in its own right. Also powered by a 6.7-liter turbodiesel, the F-350 delivers 800 lb-ft of torque &#8211; making any everyday towing job a piece of cake.<br />
<strong><em>Ford F-150</em></strong><br />
With a more everyday use intent behind its design, the F-150 is perfect for lighter work hauling. The F-150 configuration using the 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 gives drivers just over 11,000 pounds of towing capacity, which is perfect for light hauling like fishing boats, light trailers for dirt bikes or jet skis, and smaller pop-up campers. If you&#8217;re not planning to haul much beyond your weekend or cabin outdoor toys, a well-maintained F-150 will get the job done with no question.<br />
<strong><em>Chevy Silverado 3500</em></strong><br />
Between heavy duty and light hauling lies the Silverado 3500. Probably best used for hauling smaller numbers of livestock and mid-level ag and construction equipment, the Silverado 3500 sports a towing capacity of over 23,000 pounds powered by a 6.6-liter turbodiesel. If you&#8217;re planning to do some intermittent hauling of larger capacity items like loaded horse trailers or agricultural equipment, a used mid-level hauler like the Silverado 3500 will be a solid work horse for many years.<br />
Regardless of your preference for specific makes or models, it&#8217;s important to discuss with the dealership or current owner as to how the vehicle in question was used and maintained. A heavily used, but well-maintained, hauler can be a much better deal than a poorly cared for truck with low mileage. If there&#8217;s any doubt as to what you&#8217;re being told, be sure to consult an independent mechanic or third-party inspection company to confirm what you&#8217;re being told.<br />
