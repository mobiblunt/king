								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a> and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

While November and December are obvious months when online shoppers should keep their guard up, in recent years there has been a significant uptick in financial and identity theft attempts around Valentine&#8217;s Day as well. Following the simple tips below can help to ensure that your Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping around the web doesn&#8217;t end in financial heartbreak.<br />
<strong><em>Be Wary of Dating Sites</em></strong><br />
Those looking for love are often feeling a little extra lonely this time of year. Scammers know this as well, and will often take advantage of those that are maybe a little too desperate to find that perfect someone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with someone through an online dating website, take the same pause that you would when shopping for a high dollar item like a classic car or luxury watch. As you communicate with the other person, a definite red flag should be an avoidance of conversation anywhere other than via email. While it&#8217;s prudent to be cautious when communicating with strangers on the web, it&#8217;s also odd to not eventually move that conversation to the phone, or even in-person.<br />
<strong><em>Phishing Scams</em></strong><br />
Similar to the routines run by criminals during the holiday season, many scammers will send out emails dressed in the guise of an online retailer or shipping company. If you receive an email that just doesn&#8217;t look quite right, or comes from an email address you don&#8217;t recognize, NEVER click on any embedded links. Many browsers will allow you to preview any hyperlinked text by simply scrolling over the text. Before you click, look toward the bottom left-hand site of your browser window to see where that link will send you.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Fall Too Fast</em></strong><br />
Love at first site is always possible, but be cautious if anyone on a dating website professes love right out of the gate. We all hope that that perfect someone is out there, but if something seems too good to be true it probably is. These claims of love are often followed by a deep desire to visit the other party in person, but they&#8217;re unable to due to financial hardship. Scammers will then ask their targets to wire money directly, or send a personal check so that they can then make the trip to visit. Of course, that trip never happens, and the target is out whatever funds were sent.<br />
Nobody wants to assume that every chance at love could be someone simply trying to scam them out of money, but taking the time to pause and reflect on any &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; scenario this time of year is a smart move.<br />

From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

Nowadays, it seems that everyone is receiving the bulk of their financial information in their email inbox. Banking statements, credit card statements, utility bills, mortgage statements &#8211; nearly all of these pop up monthly in your gmail or Yahoo! account. So, with so much important information being transmitted over the web, how can you tell the legitimate emails from the fake ones?<br />
<strong><em>1. Huge Numbers of Recipients</em></strong><br />
If a scammer has compromised someone&#8217;s email account one of the first things they&#8217;ll often do is to blast malware-containing emails out to that user&#8217;s entire contact list. Because of this, the scammers will often have additional compromised email addresses at their disposal before the originally compromised account owner even knows what&#8217;s going on. If you happen to receive a message from someone with dozens of other people copied in as well, be very wary of clicking any links within the email itself.<br />
<strong><em>2. Huge Number of Links or Hidden Links</em></strong><br />
The ultimate goal of most email scams is to have the recipients click on a link that will either reveal private information or install malware onto the recipient&#8217;s system. So, if you receive an email with more links than written copy, be careful. Often times with scam emails the entire body of the email will just be one giant link. Thankfully, many web browsers like Chrome and Mozilla will allow you to preview any link before actually clicking. Simply scroll your mouse over the link in question and the browser will show you the full URL that that link is directing you to &#8211; generally either next to the cursor arrow or toward the bottom, left-hand side of the browser window. If you don&#8217;t recognize the destination link, DO NOT CLICK.<br />
<strong><em>3. Grammar and Spelling Gaffs</em></strong><br />
Not many people will write grammatically flawless emails &#8211; especially if they&#8217;re in a hurry. But scam emails that originate in foreign countries will often contain obvious and uncommon spelling and grammar errors. Misspellings of a company&#8217;s full name, everyday words, and sporadic capitalization should all be red flags if the email in question is being presented as a formal communication from a business. When in doubt, call the company or individual that supposedly sent you the email to confirm whether or not it was actually sent by them.<br />
<strong><em>4. Obvious Get-Rich-Quick Schemes</em></strong><br />
Anytime someone sends out a message that promises ways for you to get rich quick, attract any sexual partner you desire, or increase the size of your anatomy are obvious ploys that pray on individual insecurities. Like countless relatives and parents have taught you: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
<strong><em>5. Strange or Inappropriate Requests</em></strong><br />
Rarely will your best friend or sister shoot you an email to ask for a few thousand dollars, or to float them some cash for an emergency medical procedure. Scammers know that some people are likely to throw caution to the wind if they believe that their loved ones are in danger or dire need. If you get an email from someone close to you that requests anything that seems out of place, take a few minutes to call them directly and see if the situation is truly as it seems. Not only could you save yourself some time and money, but they&#8217;ll likely appreciate the call and knowing you were so concerned.<br />
The most powerful weapon you have in your arsenal to combat email scams is common sense. Most of the scenarios listed above are designed to outright trick you, or blow away your everyday defenses by presenting dangerous and outlandish scenarios. Taking the time to stop, think, and confirm anything that seems amiss can help ensure that your next suspicious emails stops at the inbox and never reaches your bank accounts.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2197 size-full" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fraud_crossword-300x183.jpg" width="300" height="183" />Nobody likes planning for worst case scenarios, but preparing for the worst can help save you time and money. When buying or selling collectables, jewelry, or firearms through online auction or classified sites, there are a few things you should watch out for. The tips below can help you spot fraudulent or doctored items.<br />
<strong><em>Inspection, Inspection, Inspection</em></strong><br />
In real estate it&#8217;s all about location, but when buying or selling online it&#8217;s all about inspections. Provide any possible certificates of authenticity for collectables, appraisals from certified gem experts, and documentation for any collector firearm. The more information that you provide, or that is provided to you, the easier it will be for you or the other party to verify that information with another expert.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds &#8211; Lock In Sales</em></strong><br />
Consider using an<a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank"> online escrow</a> company to secure funds for your next transaction. Escrow companies work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller by acting as a neutral third party to hold and transmit funds. Buyers are protected as funds are held with a third party and only released when they have proof of shipping or the item has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are protected as well as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks, and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Consider an Intermediary</em></strong><br />
A common scam &#8211; especially for jewelry &#8211; is for the buyer to receive the item, swap out the precious stones for fakes, and then return the item claiming that it was fake to begin with or that it wasn&#8217;t as described in the ad. Now the original owner is out the precious stone with no way to prove it was genuine to begin with. To combat this type of scam, consider a similar approach as those who ship firearms by shipping to a jewelry inspector as an intermediary. The inspector verifies the item as it&#8217;s shipped to the buyer and then if the items are shipped back, they verify them again to ensure no switcheroo took place. You can use this same process when shipping any items of value.<br />
While some of the processes described above can take a little extra time to complete, they work for the benefit of both parties in any transactions where the buyer and seller are relative unknowns to each other. Taking some time for additional inspections or to draft up a proper purchase agreement that outlines payment and shipping expectations can not only save you time and money but can preserve a sale that may have gone south over simple misunderstandings or gaps in communication.<br />

<strong><em>Unusually Low Pricing</em></strong><br />
While this is one of the most common ways of luring in desperate buyers, it works. Scammers will list an above-average condition vehicle at a price that is significantly lower that other vehicles of the same make, model and year. Once the buyer is hooked, they&#8217;ll often partner this low-listing scam with an overpayment scam or a request for a deposit wired direct through MoneyGram or WesternUnion.<br />
<em><strong>Listings from Another Country</strong></em><br />
Again, these listings will usually have a very sound price, but with a seller who is located overseas. Often times the lister will also pair this reasonable price with an offer of free shipping from their home country. This is a GIANT red flag as overseas shipping can easily cost thousands of dollars by the time taxes and customs fees are added to the shipping cost itself.<br />
<em><strong>Look for Mentions of eBay and Other Supposed Guarantors</strong></em><br />
Craigslist has yet to partner with another ecommerce company like eBay or ClassicCars.com. However, this has not stopped scammers from trying to waylay the fears of potential victims by using the names of these reputable companies. Should you come across an ad that claims eBay or another site has guaranteed the purchase, or will cover potential losses in any way, walk away. The only listings companies like eBay may cover or offer protection for are the listings on their own websites.<br />
<em><strong>Inability to Provide Photos</strong></em><br />
Most ads on Craigslist will provide some sort of image of the car, but it&#8217;s a good idea to ask for additional photos. Many scammers will simply pull photos from listings on a legitimate website and pass them off as their own. If the lister is unable to provide additional photos, or claims to not have physical access to the vehicle to verify any inquiries you&#8217;ll want to be very cautious if you choose to proceed at all.<br />
<em><strong>Protect Yourself and Your Finances</strong></em><br />
When you&#8217;re buying or selling items online, one of the easiest ways to keep yourself from falling victim to any type of scam is to use an <a title="PaySAFE Vehicle Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE act as a neutral third party between a buyer and seller who are relative unknowns to each other. Buyers are protected as all purchase funds are held securely in escrow until the seller has provided proof that the item has shipped, or it has already arrived. Sellers are equally protected as all purchase funds are verified in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of insufficient funds, fraudulent checks or credit card chargebacks.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no big secret that online fraud and scams are running 24/7. Phishing schemes, identity theft, data breaches &#8211; all of these phrases have become somewhat commonplace in headlines and news recaps every evening, but did you really know the extent to which online fraud attempts really happen? A company called ThreatMetrix has compiled a pretty amazing <a href="http://www.threatmetrix.com/threatmetrix-labs/web-fraud-map/" target="_blank">real-time map that shows fraud attempts against the users they protect</a>.<br />
While the screenshot of the map below only shows the attempts against accounts that TreatMetrix monitors, there are certainly more attempts taken than what&#8217;s shown through the company&#8217;s data.

In addition to larger online marketplaces like <a href="http://classiccars.com" target="_blank">ClassicCars.com</a> or <a href="http://autotrader.com" target="_blank">AutoTrader.com</a>, buyers and sellers are flocking to Craigslist as the replacement for their local classifieds. While the postings are virtually endless, the anonymity that Craigslist provides has raised concerns as to the safety and validity surrounding the site&#8217;s listing. Granted, the vast majority of the items posted to Craigslist are on the up and up, the short guide below should provide some additional tips for buyers and sellers new to Craigslist.<br />
<strong><em>Read Between the Lines</em></strong><br />
Taking cues from the listing itself can be a big help. Does the posting seem aggressive? Is it riddled with spelling errors or mismatched and incorrect information? The way a posting is written can give you clues as to the buyer&#8217;s or seller&#8217;s personality. Much like human resources professionals can quickly weed out resumes based on sketchy information, so can a savvy car buyer.<br />
<strong><em>Ask for Paperwork</em></strong><br />
In the back and forth that takes place on Craigslist before you agree to purchase the vehicle, ask about paperwork. This should go without saying with ANY vehicle purchase, but again, the anonymity of the site will often lead to vague descriptions that don&#8217;t provide near the depth of information that other car listing sites will provide. If you agree to inspect the vehicle and paperwork in person, be sure to go over the documents with a fine toothed comb.<br />
<strong><em>Bring a Friend and Keep it Public</em></strong><br />
The vast majority of Craigslist purchases take place face-to-face. This is the element of Craigslist purchases that makes some buyers and sellers the most apprehensive. As the saying goes, there&#8217;s strength in numbers, so bringing a friend along for the ride can&#8217;t hurt. Numbers can also come in handy by meeting in a public place. Parking lots of busy department stores, malls or restaurants can also add a layer of security and reassurance for both you and the other party.<br />
<strong><em>Take a Lap</em></strong><br />
Before you walk right up to the prospective vehicle or buyer, consider driving or walking a lap at a distance. Taking a lap gives you a chance to double check that the vehicle at least appears as advertised, and also give the scene a quick survey. If everything looks as it should you can proceed as planned. If your warm-up lap doesn&#8217;t look right you can call the buyer or seller and let them know that you&#8217;ve decided to pass on the transaction.<br />
<em><strong>Weed Out Window Shoppers</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re selling a popular make or model you&#8217;ll likely be dealing with a number of offers and requests for information. You can vet serious buyers by requesting that ALL buyers be willing to use an escrow service. <a title="PaySAFE Vehicle Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> actually work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller. Sellers know that the buyer is serious as all purchase funds are verified up front before the vehicle leaves their possession. Buyers know that their funds are held securely with a third party until they can verify that the item in question is as it was advertised.</p>
