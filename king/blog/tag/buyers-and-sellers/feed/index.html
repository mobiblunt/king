								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/buy-and-sell.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2092" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/buy-and-sell.jpg" alt="buy-and-sell" width="294" height="215" /></a>Selling personal and commercial items online is a great way to open up your goods to an enormous audience. Online buyers also have the advantage of shopping through millions of products from the comfort of their couch or office chair. While there is tremendous opportunity for both parties, how can you safely complete a transaction with someone who many not be just across town, but across the globe? Following the tips below can help to ensure that whether you&#8217;re buying or selling, you&#8217;ll always be safe.<br />
<strong><em>Keep Things Disposable</em></strong><br />
Many online auction and classified websites have their own email system where buyers and sellers can communicate within the platform. However, not all sites offer this type of functionality. If you don&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to communicate with the other party through the host sites system, consider creating a non-specific and easily deleted email account. This allows you to keep your regular emails from family and friends separated from any communications with unknown buyers and sellers. That insulation layer can also provide protection against scammers who may try to hack your email.<br />
<strong><em>Go Beyond Email</em></strong><br />
Communication through email is incredibly convenient, but it can also provide scammers a great place to hide. If you&#8217;re comfortable, attempt a phone conversation with the other party. Not only does this allow you to establish that there is a real person on the other end of the transaction, but it can be a great way to iron out details that may not translate well in an email message.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Consider using an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow is great for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially when steep price tags are involved. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs. Buyers are also protected because funds are held securely with a neutral third party, and generally aren&#8217;t released until there is proof that the item has shipped or has even arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
It not difficult to believe that any seller will always try to present their item in the best possible light. Some sellers will take things a bit too far and attempt to conceal damaged items. While you may be tempted to take the seller at their word you should always consider an inspection. Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will setup a time for one of their lookers to visit the item you&#8217;re considering, and document the actual condition of the item. Depending on your requirements, these inspectors can even shoot video, or perform custom inspections to make sure that all of your concerns are addressed.<br />
When it call comes down to it, most people are better at recognizing a potential scam than they realize. If you ever get the feeling that something just isn&#8217;t right, or that it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. In that situation you should never feel badly about simply walking away from the deal.<br />

The internet has placed infinite resources at our fingertips and opened up massive person-to-person marketplaces for buying and selling anything under the sun. Even still, there are some situations where using a broker can be advantageous for buying and selling online.<br />
<strong><em>Short on Time</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s true that you can find nearly anything you would like on online classified sites or auctions, but do you have the time to dedicate to your search? Hard-to-find items can take weeks track down and often require knowledge of niche markets. Unless you happen to have access to those types of marketplaces, a broker can be a great alternative. Brokers have taken years to develop the relationships and connections needed to find buyers and sellers for highly specialized or rare items.<br />
<strong><em>Save the Paperwork</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve found the car or artwork you&#8217;re looking for you now have to draft up the proper paperwork to complete the transaction and ensure that you have the correct documentation. Again, brokers can save you time and hassle as they put together these types of deals on a regular basis &#8211; gathering all the paperwork together for you and the other party into one single portfolio.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Brokers will often work with an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other financial entity to ensure that the transfer of funds is safe and secure. Brokers that work with a platform like PaySAFE have the ability to compile the purchase agreement and any additional documentation or photos into a single interface for both the buyer and seller to view. PaySAFE then coordinates with the broker to ensure that all funds are verified and held before the seller ships the item, and that the buyer has proof of shipping or confirms delivery before their purchase funds are deposited directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice.<br />
Ultimately, the decision as to whether or not you would like to use a broker comes down to personal preference. Some buyers and sellers enjoy coordinating all aspects of a transaction on their own and have the time to do so. But if you&#8217;re a busy individual in search of a highly specialized or rare item, looking into the services of a broker may be a great alternative.<br />

In addition to larger online marketplaces like <a href="http://classiccars.com" target="_blank">ClassicCars.com</a> or <a href="http://autotrader.com" target="_blank">AutoTrader.com</a>, buyers and sellers are flocking to Craigslist as the replacement for their local classifieds. While the postings are virtually endless, the anonymity that Craigslist provides has raised concerns as to the safety and validity surrounding the site&#8217;s listing. Granted, the vast majority of the items posted to Craigslist are on the up and up, the short guide below should provide some additional tips for buyers and sellers new to Craigslist.<br />
<strong><em>Read Between the Lines</em></strong><br />
Taking cues from the listing itself can be a big help. Does the posting seem aggressive? Is it riddled with spelling errors or mismatched and incorrect information? The way a posting is written can give you clues as to the buyer&#8217;s or seller&#8217;s personality. Much like human resources professionals can quickly weed out resumes based on sketchy information, so can a savvy car buyer.<br />
<strong><em>Ask for Paperwork</em></strong><br />
In the back and forth that takes place on Craigslist before you agree to purchase the vehicle, ask about paperwork. This should go without saying with ANY vehicle purchase, but again, the anonymity of the site will often lead to vague descriptions that don&#8217;t provide near the depth of information that other car listing sites will provide. If you agree to inspect the vehicle and paperwork in person, be sure to go over the documents with a fine toothed comb.<br />
<strong><em>Bring a Friend and Keep it Public</em></strong><br />
The vast majority of Craigslist purchases take place face-to-face. This is the element of Craigslist purchases that makes some buyers and sellers the most apprehensive. As the saying goes, there&#8217;s strength in numbers, so bringing a friend along for the ride can&#8217;t hurt. Numbers can also come in handy by meeting in a public place. Parking lots of busy department stores, malls or restaurants can also add a layer of security and reassurance for both you and the other party.<br />
<strong><em>Take a Lap</em></strong><br />
Before you walk right up to the prospective vehicle or buyer, consider driving or walking a lap at a distance. Taking a lap gives you a chance to double check that the vehicle at least appears as advertised, and also give the scene a quick survey. If everything looks as it should you can proceed as planned. If your warm-up lap doesn&#8217;t look right you can call the buyer or seller and let them know that you&#8217;ve decided to pass on the transaction.<br />
<em><strong>Weed Out Window Shoppers</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re selling a popular make or model you&#8217;ll likely be dealing with a number of offers and requests for information. You can vet serious buyers by requesting that ALL buyers be willing to use an escrow service. <a title="PaySAFE Vehicle Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> actually work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller. Sellers know that the buyer is serious as all purchase funds are verified up front before the vehicle leaves their possession. Buyers know that their funds are held securely with a third party until they can verify that the item in question is as it was advertised.</p>
