While these sites do an excellent job of monitoring and vetting users, if you&#8217;re new to online auctions and classified listings the process can be a bit daunting. The tips below can be a great help for buyers new to the online firearms world, and make sure that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard when you&#8217;ve found a used rifle that meets your needs.<br />
<strong><em>Ask Questions</em></strong><br />
Many times new buyers can be bashful when it comes to asking questions for sellers. You should never feel bad about asking too many questions. Veteran sellers will have all kinds of information at their disposal for the items they&#8217;re selling, and more often than not are happy to provide whatever they can. You should also ask questions of any customer service reps that the auction or classified site my provide. If things aren&#8217;t clearly spelled out from either the seller or the website&#8217;s FAQ, ask away!<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s a 50/50 shot as to whether or not a given website will have a secure checkout process. Even if the site does provide a checkout service, you should strongly consider an <a title="Gun Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service for any larger purchase. Online escrow works to protect you AND the seller. Buyers are protected as all funds are held with a neutral third party until there is proof that the rifle has shipped, or has even arrived at your chosen FFL holder for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as your purchase funds are verified and held upfront, completely removing the seller&#8217;s chances of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
<strong><em>Secure a Quality Inspection</em></strong><br />
Unless you happen to be an expert gunsmith you&#8217;ll want to line up an inspection. Companies like WeGoLook.com can schedule an inspector to visit the rifle in question and report back to you what they find. Depending on the specifications of the rifle, you may also want to build in time for you to inspect the rifle yourself once it arrives &#8211; especially if there are any custom components that the previous owner has added themselves.<br />
Ultimately, as the buyer the onus is on you to ensure that what you&#8217;re buying is what you think it is. While any legitimate seller will do their best to work with you on price, shipping and inspections, it&#8217;s up to you as the buyer to educate yourself as thoroughly as possibly on the processes and rifle itself.<br />

From rare and one-of-a-kind antique pistols to everyday workhorse revolvers, used handguns often have second, third, and fourth lives after the original owner has moved on. So if you&#8217;re in the market for an everyday revolver, what are some of the most common points you should examine if you&#8217;re unable to have the revolver examined professionally?<br />
<strong><em>Extreme Sights</em></strong><br />
If the revolver you looking at has adjustable sights, take a close look at the rear sight. Is it near the center or is it shifted to the extreme on one side or the other? Adjustable sights that are to the extreme can indicate that there is an issue with accuracy. If at all possible, ask the seller for the chance to fire the handgun to ensure that the accuracy is as it should be.<br />
<em><strong>Barrel Bulges</strong></em><br />
After ensuring that the gun isn&#8217;t loaded, take a moment to look down the barrel in search of any bulges. You should do the same with the cylinder of any revolver. Bulges in either component is a major issue and should be brought to the attention of the seller. Bulges in the barrel or cylinder are also cause for any buyer to walk away from a purchase, no questions asked.<br />
<strong><em>Overall Cleanliness</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve ensured that both the barrel and cylinder are free of any bulges, take a few moments to examine the overall cleanliness of the handgun. If the gun is an antique, does the patina look appropriate? Are there any scratches or dings on the muzzle? Is the inside of the barrel freshly oiled? Freshly oiled barrels can be a sign that the current owner is attempting to hide any potential imperfections as the oil reflects and inspection light.<br />
<strong><em>Cylinder Gap and Firing Pin</em></strong><br />
Because of the rotation of the cylinder in revolvers, the cylinder gap is critical. Be sure to rotate the cylinder at least one time around to ensure that the cylinder is properly balanced and the spacing is appropriate &#8211; not too far, or too tight. The ideal spacing for any revolver cylinder is .006&#8243;, but should never exceed .010&#8243;. Once you&#8217;ve given the cylinder an all clear, be sure to examine the firing pin as well. The tip of the pin should be rounded and smooth, not pointed and sharp. The firing pin hole should also be free of chips or dings.<br />
<strong><em>Get It Inspected</em></strong><br />
Unless you have a great deal of experience in examining firearms, your best bet is to have an expert lend their eye to any handgun you&#8217;re looking to purchase. Using an <a title="Firearm Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service is an excellent way to build in time for you to have any handgun examined before parting with your purchase funds, as funds should not be released without your say so. Online escrow also benefits the seller as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; removing all risk of nonpayment.<br />

While you may have looked long and hard to find your dream hunting rifle, how can you trust that what you pick up from your <a title="How to Find a Local FFL" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/05/21/how-to-find-a-local-ffl/" target="_blank">local FFL</a> will really be what was advertised?<br />
<strong><em>Use a Reputable Website</em></strong><br />
There are literally dozens of websites that bring together buyers and individual sellers or brokers, but not all of those sites are legitimate. Reputable firearms websites like <a title="GunBroker.com Website" href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank">GunBroker.com</a> will often have a buyer or seller protection program that will cover at least a portion of your purchase. When in doubt, contact customer service for the website in question. If you&#8217;re unable to get any type of response, or the email you receive in reply is riddled with spelling errors and broken links, you&#8217;ll likely want to find a new website to buy and sell through.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve locked in your seller or won your buyer&#8217;s bid. At that point, keeping an open line of communication with the other party can help to head off any potential issues. The vast majority of deals that fall through do so because of simple misunderstandings that could&#8217;ve easily been ironed out with a phone call or a few short emails.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
The most common question we receive during transactions is &#8220;How can I really trust the other party?&#8221; The simplest and most transparent way to put a nervous buyer or seller at ease is through the use of escrow. <a title="PaySAFE Firearms Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> platforms simply act as a neutral third party to hold and transmit funds between two unknown parties. Buyers are protected as all funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has arrived for a final once over. Sellers are protected because all purchase funds are verified in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds or credit card chargebacks.<br />
When it comes right down to it, most of us are better at sniffing out a bad deal than we realize. If either party is difficult to contact, continually balks at answering additional questions, or makes ridiculous ultimatums it may simply be time to walk away. And, as always, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
