								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thompson-submachine.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2144" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/thompson-submachine.jpg?w=300" alt="thompson submachine" width="300" height="167" /></a>There isn&#8217;t a buyer on the planet who wouldn&#8217;t want to know the condition of a vehicle before extending an offer to a buyer, so why wouldn&#8217;t you do the same thing for a modern or collector firearm? While the condition of a vehicle may be more readily apparent, there are many nuances that a seasoned buyer will know to look for. The same can be said for firearms. Organizations like the <a href="http://www.nramuseum.org/gun-info-research/what%27s-my-gun-worth.aspx" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a> have tried to make the process a little easier for both buyers and sellers by establishing widely accepted rating scales for both modern and collector firearms. Familiarizing yourself with the scales listed below can be a big time saver, and give both buyers and sellers a realistic idea of what a firearm is worth.<br />
<strong><em>Modern Gun Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New/Perfect</strong>: This condition level looks like it&#8217;s never left the factory packaging.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: The firearm may have been used a few times, but there is zero sign of wear and tear. Wood, metal and bluing are in perfect condition except at the muzzle or any sharp edges.</li>
<li><strong>Very good</strong>: Perfect working condition, but with no noticeable wear on working components. No corrosion or pitting present.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Safe working condition. Minor wear is likely present on working components, but still no corrosion or pitting.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Safe working condition, but well worn. Replacement of some components may be needed. No rust should be present, but some minor corrosion is not uncommon at this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Antique/Collector Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory New</strong>: 100% original parts and finish. Perfect working condition inside and out.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: This level still has all the original parts and 80%+ of the original finish. Any stamping, lettering or design on wood or metal is still crisp and clear. The wood should also unmarred and the bore in great condition.</li>
<li><strong>Fine</strong>: All original parts, but with 30%+ or so of the original finishing. Letter and stamping should also still be in near perfect condition, but dings or slight scratches on wood surfaces are present.</li>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: All original parts are present, but less than 30% of the original finish remains. All metal surfaces are original and still have crisp, sharp edges. Stenciling or lettering is clear, but wood surfaces have more noticeable scratches or dings. Bore condition is also less important at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Repair or replacement of minor parts. Rust may be present, but is smooth with minimal to no pitting and possible re-bluing of the finish. Letters and numbers are legible, and scratches or dents in wood surfaces may have been refinished or repaired.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Major components may have been replaced at this level of conditioning, and minor parts may still need repairing or replacement. Light pitting is present over most of the firearm, and rust is more noticeable. Finishing has likely been cleaned vigorously or noticeably re-blued. Sharp edges have been worn down or rounded, and lettering or stencils may be partially worn away. The key is to be in decent working order, or can be made into that condition with a little effort.</li>
<li>Poor: Significant work would need to be done to bring this type of collector firearm back into working condition. Replacement and repair of both major and minor parts, significant pitting and rust, scratched surfaces, completely worn away printing and stenciling, and complete inoperability are calling cards of this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other commonly used ratings systems include the <em>Blue Book of Gun Values</em>, based on the original finish system of rating, and <em>The Standard Catalog of Firearms</em>, which uses a system similar to the NRA rating terms, but with significantly different qualifications as to which items fall into which category.<br />

One resource can be a major benefit in helping to negotiate those laws if you&#8217;re new to collecting firearms or interstate purchases &#8211; anyone with a Federal Firearms License, or FFL. These individuals have gone through extensive training to learn the ins and outs of the requirements set by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms when it comes to buying, selling and shipping antique or modern firearms. But how can you find an FFL?<br />
If you&#8217;re an avid collector you likely already have a preferred FFL dealer that&#8217;s your go-to, but if you&#8217;re new to your area or are simply new to the collector scene there are a few helpful resources that can guide you to an FFL holder in your city.<br />
GunBroker.com has a helpful database that can help you <a title="Find an FFL - GunBroker.com" href="http://www.gunbroker.com/ffl/dealernetwork.aspx" target="_blank">find an FFL</a>. Over time, this website has cataloged an extensive listing of all the registered FFL holders throughout the United States. GunBroker.com has also gathered a listing of dealers licensed for <a title="International Firearms Transfer Agents" href="http://www.gunbroker.com/ffl/DealerInternational.aspx" target="_blank">international firearms trade</a> should you be buying or selling overseas. The governments of various foreign countries often have laws in place that vary widely from those here in the U.S., and these international firearms experts can be invaluable sources of information.<br />
If you&#8217;re more of the face-to-face meeting type of person, you can always pitstop at your local gunsmith or outdoor goods store. If there are not any FFLs on staff at either of those locations they&#8217;ll likely know exactly which direction to point you.<br />
<strong>For more information about FFLs and the procedures needed to become licensed yourself, <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/how-to/become-an-ffl.html" target="_blank">visit the ATF&#8217;s website here</a>.</strong></p>

<em>Disclaimer: The topics and guidelines discussed in this post pertain to the importing and exporting of firearms in the <strong>United States only</strong>. For regulations governing the import and export of firearms in a country other than the U.S., please consult with your local governing bodies.</em><br />
Online auctions and marketplaces like <a title="GunBroker.com" href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank">GunBroker.com</a> have opened up collector and antique firearms to a global audience. While this is great news when you&#8217;ve got an item up for sale, it can turn quickly turn into a hassle if the buyer lives overseas. While shipping internationally isn&#8217;t impossible, there are strict processes that must be followed anytime you import or export firearms from the United States.<br />
<strong><em>Do Your Homework</em></strong><br />
Firearms laws vary greatly from country to country. As a seller, it&#8217;s important to do some digging should you have a buyer located abroad &#8211; for example it can be nearly impossible to import a handgun in Japan. There are also a number of items that are illegal to import or export from country to country. In the U.S., these items include such things as armor-piercing ammunition, high-capacity magazines and certain items deemed to be considered assault rifles. Because the laws vary so greatly from place to place, you&#8217;ll need to work with an firearms exporting expert who can help you through the process, which bring us to our next topic.<br />
<strong><em>Exporting Firearms from the United States</em></strong><br />
Firearms can only be exported from the United States via a licensed exporter that is located within the United States. Much like businesses or individuals with an Federal Firearms License (FFL), these exporters are properly licensed and have the depth of knowledge needed when working with customs departments around the globe. GunBroker.com has a <a title="List of Firearms Exporters - GunBroker.com" href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Support/SupportFAQView.aspx?FAQID=1110&amp;NoCount=1" target="_blank">list of firearms exporters,</a> or you can check around locally for recommendations or through search engines like Google.<br />
<strong><em>Importing Firearms into the United States</em></strong><br />
Those without a FFL license MAY NOT import any item considered to be a firearm.Â Any individual with a FFL may import a firearm for personal use or for another individual. While the FFL holder does not need to posses an importer&#8217;s license of occasional imports, there are certain forms that are required:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;">The licensee must first submit a ATF Form 6, Part I to the Imports Branch for approval.Â </span>The licensee may then present the approved Form 6 and completed ATF Form 6A to the U.S. Customs Service. Contact the Bureau of ATF, Imports Branch, Washington, DC 20226, (202) 927-8320 for forms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Items that may be accessories but are not considered to be actual firearms may be imported without any special consideration or precautions. This would include things like holsters, scopes, ammo bags, etc.<br />
Again, because of the wide variance in rules and regulations, we highly recommend contacting your preferred FFL holder to discuss the item you&#8217;re looking to purchase prior to transferring any funds. Because of the frequency with which regulations can change, these FFL import and export experts can be the difference between securing a great find or spending your cash on fines and lawyer&#8217;s fees.<br />
