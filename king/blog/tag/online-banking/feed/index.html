With each site requiring a password, it can be very tempting to simply repeat the same password often, or keep all of your passwords simple, but simple and often repeated passwords can be easy prey for hackers and online fraudsters. To ensure that your online accounts and the personal or financial information associated with each is kept safe, we&#8217;ve lined up six tips below to help keep your passwords strong.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Repeat Passwords</em></strong><br />
It may seem somewhat simple, but you should never repeat the exact same password for multiple logins. While you may want to use the same root word or number, it&#8217;s imperative that you add some unique characters to each account. Using this approach, hackers may be able to compromise a single account, but will have difficulty gaining access to other sites.<br />
<strong><em>Use Long, Sentence-Based Passwords</em></strong><br />
When most people think of passwords they think of a single word or combination of letters, but the only real limit to your passwords are character restrictions. Using an entire sentence of short phrase as your password can make your accounts extremely difficult to access for outside parties. Making the sentence extremely personal, like &#8220;I grew up in Omaha,&#8221; or &#8220;My college major was communications&#8221; can make your accounts inaccessible for anyone but you.<br />
<strong><em>Use Two-Step Verification</em></strong><br />
To add an extra layer of protection, websites like Facebook and Gmail have begun to offer two-step verification. This safety measure requires a second, non-web based verification before accounts can be access, or passwords changed. Most often, the service will send a text message with an access code to a mobile device. This way, if you aren&#8217;t the one requesting the password change, you would be notified that someone else is attempting to do so.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Easily Found Information</em></strong><br />
Many of us have a various pieces of personal information scattered around in public documents. Things like birth dates, maiden names, or names of children and relatives can be found somewhat easily by those who know where to look. Avoiding passwords based on that type of information is recommended.<br />
<strong><em>Change Passwords Regularly</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve ever worked in an office that deals with sensitive information, your IT team likely required a password change every three to six months. We recommend changing the passwords for your most sensitive personal accounts regularly as well. You can make it easy to remember by tying a password change to a regularly occurring event, like when you change your car&#8217;s air filter or after each dental visit.<br />
<strong><em>Use Pneumonic Devices</em></strong><br />
In elementary school we were all taught different tricks to help recall information that is difficult to remember off the cuff &#8211; like the order of the planets or multiplication tables. You can do the same thing when your passwords. For example, the phrase &#8220;This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8221; would translate to a password of TIWWCHNT. That nonsensical jumble of letters would be difficult for anyone to guess.<br />
While there may not be a 100% foolproof method to keep your passwords out of the hands of hackers, the six tips above can ensure that you&#8217;re on the right path to keeping your personal and financial information safe.

Mobile and online banking are incredibly convenient. With busy schedules and less time to actually go to your local bank or credit union to deposit checks, get cash, or adjust investments, mobile and online banking can be major time savers. However, just as with the advent of e-commerce, banking via wifi or cell signals from your phone or laptop has opened up new avenues of exposure for your financial and personal information.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Stray From Home</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re a regular user of online banking to manage your credit cards and bank accounts, be wary of using computers you don&#8217;t normally use. While you may have an incredibly secure network of your own, the same can&#8217;t always be said about your friend&#8217;s desktop or laptop. All it takes is one quick balance check on an unfamiliar computer to unintentionally exposure your login and password to malicious spyware. Unless you&#8217;re sure about the security of another network, you&#8217;re better off waiting until you can login from home.<br />
<strong><em>Pick Complex Passwords</em></strong><br />
We&#8217;ve mentioned this security check before, but it&#8217;s imperative that you <a title="5 Simple Ways to Protect Your Privacy Online" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/11/5-simple-ways-to-protect-your-privacy-online/" target="_blank">choose a password that is more complex</a> than &#8216;12345.&#8217; The best passwords contain a mix of upper and lower-case letters, at least two numbers and a unique character like an &amp; or %. It&#8217;s also important to separate your passwords out by platform, i.e. a different root word for your Facebook login as compared to your online banking login. If one of your accounts happens to be compromised, this helps ensure that hackers aren&#8217;t able to easily access ALL of your personal and financial info from a single password. If you&#8217;re really stumped on creating tough passwords, check out this helpful post on with <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2011/11/08/8-ways-to-create-stronger-passwords" target="_blank">8 ways to create stronger passwords</a>.<br />
<em><strong>Use Secure, Updated Browsers</strong></em><br />
Not all web browsers are created equal. Be sure that you&#8217;re using a browser that is up-to-date as this ensures that any known security loopholes are closed. You should also use a browser that forces https connections whenever possible. Https connections verify that there is a more secure connection being made between your computer or mobile phone and the banking system on the other end. While this doesn&#8217;t guarantee 100% safety it&#8217;s a great place to start when determining whether or not the network is potentially compromised.<br />
<strong><em>Double Down on Password Protection</em></strong><br />
We&#8217;ve already mentioned how important passwords are when logging in to your mobile or online banking site itself, but what about your laptop or phone? Do you have a lock screen that kicks in when you haven&#8217;t used the device for specified amount of time? This is one of the simplest forms of protection as it makes it difficult for thieves to even access your device, let alone your banking website.<br />
Sadly, no matter how thorough you might be when it comes to password complexity or security of your home wifi network, nobody is completely immune from the possibility of financial information theft. If you believe that you have been a victim of financial or personal information theft, be sure to contact <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> in addition to your credit card and financial institutions.<br />
