								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When buying or selling a car, boat or RV, there’s a lot of paperwork you need to gather, complete and exchange before the sale is finalized (as we broke down in our <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/10/04/diy-guide-to-paperwork/">DIY guide</a>). However, even after everything is signed and closed legally, there are often afterthoughts that can occur, throwing a wrench in a transaction that otherwise would go off without a hitch. To help you avoid these situations, we&#8217;ve dissected some common afterthoughts and how to best prepare for them.<br />
<strong>Does your vehicle or vessel need to be inspected?</strong><br />
The answer to this question in most cases is a resounding &#8220;yes.&#8221;<br />
For local transactions, the buyer can take the lead here and take the car or RV to a trusted friend/mechanic/appraiser of their choosing. This is more complicated for transactions that occur between two states or internationally. With a little research and few phone calls, however, it&#8217;s easy to find a local inspector to do a good job &#8212; the buyer should just be sure to hire one themselves and not one recommended by the seller. Independent repair shops and most dealer service departments should be happy to do the inspection.<br />
For boats, the inspection is often called a marine survey. Like car inspections, many people hire a local surveyor to inspect the boat, who will <a href="http://www.boats.com/boat-content/sell-my-boat-guide/do-I-need-a-boat-survey/" target="_blank">complete a thorough visual inspection</a> as well as check the sound laminate with a hammer or moisture meter. The importance of the survey varies depending on the boat’s age, size and its number of systems. Both buyers and sellers can use the services of a surveyor to determine the actual value of a boat. <a href="http://www.marinesurvey.org/" target="_blank">MarineSurvey.org</a> is a good resource to find a local surveyor.<br />
<strong>Does your vehicle or vessel need to be transported?</strong><br />
If the buyer is unable to pick up this vehicle/vessel in person, transportation can be a big hassle if they&#8217;re not prepared for it. In most cases, this responsibility falls on the buyer, unless the seller is kind enough to offer their services.<br />
For cars and RVs, the buyer can usually simply drive the vehicle home. This can be tricky if the trek home requires several hundred miles of driving, as time and money restraints start to become a bigger factor. If the car is being shipped, contacting a trusted auto transport company is highly recommended. If at all possible, it’s best to do a walkthrough with the transport driver, even taking pictures of pre-transport condition. Also note that the transportation of any vehicle should <em>always</em> be insured, because damages are not uncommon.<br />
Like cars and RVs, when transporting a boat it’s best to insure the boat and make sure it’s being handled by a trusted professional. It&#8217;s not uncommon for a boat to be purchased with a trailer, which, depending on your state, may require a separate set of paperwork to acquire a title, insurance, etc. Your local DMV should have a checklist of all the necessary information.<br />
<strong>PaySAFE helps give both buyer and seller peace of mind</strong><br />
Once you and the seller finalize the sale and any afterthoughts are addressed, using PaySAFE will ensure that no money exchanges hands until the details of the transaction are completed <em>and</em> approved by both parties (including successful inspection and transportation). PaySAFE’s paperwork-free online tools are free and easy to use and act as a neutral third party which provides transparency to both buyer and seller during the entire transaction.<br />

Naturally, this can be quite the headache, so we&#8217;ve put together this DIY Guide to Paperwork to help you make sure everything&#8217;s signed and in order, ensuring the deal is closed legally and without a hitch.<br />
<em><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Check in with the DMV</strong></em><br />
Contact your state <a href="http://www.dmv.org" target="_blank">Department of Motor Vehicles</a> to find out what documents are needed in order to sell a car, boat or RV in your area. If the sale is conducted across state lines, contact the DMV in both states. Note that many local agencies have guides on their websites to help you through the process.<br />
<em><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Creating a bill of sale</strong></em><br />
What all to include in the bill of sale &#8212; sometimes called a purchase agreement &#8212; varies slightly from the type of vehicle or vessel you&#8217;re selling. If you&#8217;re having trouble creating one from scratch, there are plenty of online templates that can be used or easily adapted.<br />
For cars and RVs, the bill of sale should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Purchase date</li>
<li>Description (make, model and any upgrades)</li>
<li>Odometer reading</li>
<li>VIN number</li>
<li>Name/address of buyer and seller</li>
<li>Driver&#8217;s license number of buyer/seller</li>
<li>Seller&#8217;s statement of vehicle ownership</li>
<li>Seller&#8217;s statement that there ARE outstanding debts against the vehicle (if applicable)</li>
<li>Seller&#8217;s statement that there are no outstanding debts against the vehicle</li>
<li>Signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>For boats, the bill of sale is very similar to that of a car, and should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Purchase date</li>
<li>Description and hull number</li>
<li>Signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Title (and lien)</strong></em><br />
Titles are issued individually by state, and are very similar for cars, boats and RVs. Every time a motorized vehicle or vessel exchanges owners, a new title must be created or updated. Make sure the title is filled out entirely, front to back, with all appropriate names and signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s) &#8212; including a lienholder, if applicable. The exact specifics of issuing a title varies by state so, again, check with your local DMV.<br />
If the original title is missing, a replacement title must be acquired. The DMV has <a href="http://www.dmv.org/replacing-a-lost-title.php" target="_blank">a fantastic state-by-state guide</a> to this process, which starts with filling out an application for a replacement title. In some states, you can complete this step entirely online, while in others it requires an in-person visit to the DMV or simply mailing in an application.<br />
The title must include info about an outstanding loan on the vehicle/vessel, as the buyer won&#8217;t be able to fully register it until the loan is cleared. Likewise, if the seller is paying off a lien with the money from the sale, the buyer should contact the lienholder to make sure the money will be used for its intended purpose, getting proof that the loan will be paid off. In some cases, it&#8217;s required that the loan be paid off before the sale, so check with the lienholder to acquire the appropriate paperwork in this scenario. When a lien is involved, a lien release must be attached to the vehicle&#8217;s/vessel&#8217;s title if the county treasurer hasn&#8217;t yet released the lien.<br />
Here&#8217;s a list of to-dos when the title exchanges hands:</p>
<ul>
<li>For cars and RVs, vehicle plates should be returned to the previous owner</li>
<li>In most cases, the buyer must complete an application for the title and registration within 30 days of the purchase</li>
<li>Include the completed bill of sale with the completed title</li>
<li>Buyer submits the completed application to the county treasurer and pays appropriate fees</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Other paperwork</strong></em><br />
Aside from the bill of sale and title, the seller should hand over any warranty cards, maintenance records and any other paperwork before the final sale of the vehicle/vessel. The owner should also cancel his or her insurance once the sale is final.<br />
Some boats are purchased with a trailer, which, depending on your state, may require a separate set of paperwork to acquire a title. Your local DMV will likely have a checklist of all the necessary information.<br />
While usually not required, notarizing all of the paperwork to validate signatures is a good idea.<br />
