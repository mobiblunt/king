								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to purchase a brand new vehicle. When shopping for a pre-owned car or truck it&#8217;s normal to see some wear and tear, but not every sign of regular use is detrimental to the value of a car. Because many vehicle owners take good care of their cars, used vehicles are often a good value for those needing reliable, everyday transportation. That said, the four items listed below are components that you or your chosen inspector should pay close attention to before you write a check.<br />
<strong><em>Frame Damage</em></strong><br />
Every single other component of a vehicle relies on a sturdy frame. The frame is also designed to take the brunt of any impact from a crash, so a vehicle with a robust accident history is definitely more prone to frame damage. Short of an inspection by a professional mechanic you can look down the length and width of a vehicle to see if you notice any unnatural bends or dips in the body. Any out of place curves along the sight lines of the car can also indicate potential frame damage. Record of damaging past accidents can also usually be found by running a vehicle history report.<br />
<strong><em>Leaks</em></strong><br />
Cars rely on a myriad of fluids to stay in good working order. For those fluids to do their respective jobs, you need them to stay IN the car. Before and after a test drive be sure to check for any fluid pooling under the vehicle. Regardless of the season you&#8217;ll also want to run the AC and heater to make sure that the heating and cooling systems don&#8217;t contain any hidden leaks that would otherwise stay hidden until the next shift in seasonal weather. Signs of oil, transmission fluid and antifreeze under the vehicle should also be addressed before closing any deal.<br />

<strong><em>Alignment</em></strong><br />
One of the easiest things to check absent of a professional inspection is steering alignment. The tires on the front of your vehicle should be completely vertical and in proper alignment to be safely operated. Toe in or toe out and negative or positive chamber leanings could be indicative of needing nothing more than needing a steering alignment, but could also point to larger issues with the vehicle as a whole. The steering wheel should also rest level during a test drive with no pulling to the left or right when driving in a straight line.<br />
<strong><em>Electrical Systems</em></strong><br />
Most vehicle owners tend to take add-ons like electric door locks and windows for granted, and can easily gloss over checking those items in an inspection. Be sure to turn everything on, check headlights and tail lights, turn on the stereo, and test out any navigation systems. Poorly functioning or quickly diminishing power in the electrical system can indicate potential problems with the car&#8217;s battery, or possibly even the alternator.<br />
<strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
In the event that you&#8217;re buying a vehicle through an online classifieds or auction site, you should definitely be using a third party inspector. Our friends at <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will send someone out to inspect the vehicle you&#8217;re interested in and do everything from a simple walk around to snap a few photos, to custom inspections that culminate in a specialized report compiled by the looker.<br />
