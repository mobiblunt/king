Cars, flatware, TVs, homes &#8211; you name it and it&#8217;s likely just a quick Google search away. But there are some items that can be more tricky to purchase site unseen than others; specifically, fine art.<br />
Because tastes in fine art can vary so greatly from one person to the next, judging whether or not an advertised piece will be a perfect fit for you can be tough through a laptop screen. Save yourself some heartache and hassle by going through the checklist below before locking in that purchase.<br />
<strong><em>See Things Clearly</em></strong><br />
Most preview images that you&#8217;ll see in an online auction aren&#8217;t going to be high resolution. Screen size, color settings, the age of your monitor &#8211; all of these variables can greatly affect the way a photo looks on a computer or mobile device. Be sure that the artist or website has a high resolution image available so that you can see as much detail as possible before you even begin to discuss pricing.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid &#8220;No Returns&#8221; Sellers</em></strong><br />
Not every purchase is going to work out. There are any number of reasons that you might need to return a piece of fine art, and you would hope that the artist would be willing to accommodate those rare instances. Unless you&#8217;re 100% sure that the item you&#8217;re considering will be a perfect fit you&#8217;ll want to discuss the possibility of returns, and who would be responsible for any of the charges associated with that return.<br />
<strong><em>Measure Twice, Buy Once</em></strong><br />
Do you know how big the wall is that you&#8217;re looking to cover? Will there be enough clearance between the top of your sculpture and the ceiling? Measure any display area carefully before you even begin to browse. For framed pieces consider making a simple paper mock-up roughly the same size as the painting and put it on the wall to get a sense of what you&#8217;re getting into.<br />
<strong><em>Buy From Reputable Vendors</em></strong><br />
Anyone can slap together an online ad, so be sure that you&#8217;re purchasing and bidding on a reputable and secure site like <a title="Artnet.com" href="http://artnet.com" target="_blank">Artnet.com</a>. Consider making a call to any phone number that&#8217;s listed, or sending an email to given customer service addresses. If you&#8217;re unable to get a response from a real person it may be time to look for another vendor.<br />
Regardless of what you decide, information will always be your best friend. The more that you can learn about a specific vendor, artist or individual piece the better you&#8217;ll be able to negotiate to a price that&#8217;s fair for both you and the artist.<br />

With more and more fine art transactions taking place over the web and across the globe, buyers and sellers are both at greater risk of becoming victims of fraud. In addition to using a third party inspection service, like those services offered by our friends at <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a>, how can collectors protect themselves against potential fine art fraud? One of the most popular tools used to inspect all types of fine art is an ultraviolet light.<br />
<strong><em>How Does it Work?</em></strong><br />
Ultraviolet light reacts differently with various types of materials. When used at the 365 nanometer range, ultraviolet light will either be reflected or absorbed by some types of repair agents used to cover up flaws in fine art pieces. These very bright or very dark areas on items like paintings, ceramics, porcelain, and textiles can indicate areas that may have been repaired by the current owner or at some other point in the pieces lifetime.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Oil Paintings</em></strong><br />
Ideally, there should be a light blue haze that appears over the entire surface of the painting. This means that there&#8217;s an original coat of varnish present, and that the piece itself has had little to no restorative work done. While masking varnish can be used to conceal repairs and give the appearance of original varnishing, the uniformity of that more recent varnishing should be a dead giveaway. Dark blue-violet coloring can also indicate the presence of repair putty.<br />
<strong><em>UV with Ceramics and Porcelain</em></strong><br />
Repaired cracks will show as bright white when examined under UV light. UV examination can be especially helpful with color glasses cracks and repairs are more easily hidden by dark colors than with clear glass.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Textiles</em></strong><br />
Like ceramics and porcelain, textile repairs are easily spotted when inspected under UV light. Original threading in antique pieces will nor fluoresce under inspection the same way that newer thread will. The dyes used in more modern threads will react with an almost white light when exposed to UV rays.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Stone, Carvings, or Clocks</em></strong><br />
Natural stones will also react differently under UV light based on its age. Stone like marble will fluoresce as a strong purple if it was recently carve, but show as a muddled white if it has been aged. Aged ivory while take on a yellowish tone under UV, but newer ivory will shine with an intense purple color. Repair of clocks can also be easily spotted as the faces of the clocks themselves will appear as a blinding white if they have been repaired using modern materials.<br />
<strong><em>Protect &amp; Inspect</em></strong><br />
The best way to protect yourself from fraud is to put protections in place prior to buying or selling. <a title="Fine Art Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> services are the safest way to transmit funds between parties. Buyers are protected as funds are held safely with a neutral third party until there&#8217;s proof that the items has shipped, or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held up front &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds and credit card chargebacks. Buyers should also make it clear to their counter parts that they plan to have an item inspected prior to locking in payment plans. This isn&#8217;t intended as an insult to the seller, but due diligence that shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.<br />
