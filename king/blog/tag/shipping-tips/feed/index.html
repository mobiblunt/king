While there are definite risks when it comes to international shipping, there are a few easy tips that anyone should follow when it comes to shipping any items internationally.<br />
<strong><em>Start Small</em></strong><br />
Like most skills, arranging international shipping requires practice and repetition to make sure all your i&#8217;s are dotted and t&#8217;s are crossed. The easiest way to get the hang of things is to start be shipping small, easier-to-package items. Maybe a simple gift for your niece studying abroad for a semester or a house warming gift for that friend spending a week in Tokyo. Mastering the basics with lesser-valued items can help reduce the stress and confusing when moving on to bigger ticket purchases.<br />
<em><strong>Speak the Same Language</strong></em><br />
Start by shipping between countries that share a common language. There&#8217;s no point in adding the risk of translation errors to the mix when you may not be 100% familiar with packing requirements or postage.<br />
<em><strong>Ask the Experts</strong></em><br />
Organizations like the United States Postal Service have international shipping down to a science. The USPS&#8217; <a title="USPS International Shipping How-To Guide" href="https://www.usps.com/ship/international-how-to.htm" target="_blank">International How-To Guide</a> and <a title="USPS International Addressing Tips" href="https://www.usps.com/send/international-addressing-tips.htm" target="_blank">International Addressing Tips</a> are great places to start if you&#8217;ve never shipped internationally before.<br />
With all of the information now available on the internet, international shipping isn&#8217;t nearly as daunting of a task as it once was. However, if a Google search or Facebook post doesn&#8217;t yield the answers you&#8217;re looking for, a call to your local post office can usually help clear up and issues. Happy shipping!</p>

Congrats! Now comes the task of making sure it arrives safely from the seller, who just happens to live across the country. When you&#8217;re looking to ship any type of vehicle over a long distance there are a few items that you need to keep in mind to ensure your dream purchase doesn&#8217;t turn into a nightmare:<br />
<em><strong>1. Prepare</strong></em><br />
Any shipping company will want some basic information before they can give an estimate or schedule for pick-up. Items like the exact weight and dimensions of your vehicle can greatly effect the requirements for the shipper. Oversized vehicles like SUVs or custom designs can also incur extra fees, so be sure to ask additional questions if your dream car goes beyond traditional dimensions. Also be sure to thoroughly read through any paperwork &#8211; especially the <a title="Bill of Lading on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading" target="_blank">bill of lading</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s presented once the shipper arrives.<br />
<em><strong>2. Know Your Shipping Options</strong></em><br />
There&#8217;s definitely more than one way to ship a car. Some of the most common types of shipping vessels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enclosed or open containers</li>
<li>Multi-car trailer trucks or a pick-up, often called a hotshot</li>
<li>Non-stacking trailers</li>
<li>Multi-level carriers (you see these commonly at dealerships)</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of shipping options you choose will likely vary depending on the type of vehicle you&#8217;re shipping. You may also want to look around for shippers who specialize in a specific type of vehicle as well, such as classic cars or off-road vehicles.<br />
<em><strong>3. Know Your Shipper</strong></em><br />
Do some ground work and background research on any person or company that offers to ship your vehicle. It never hurts to ask about items like insurance, certifications and/or if the person your speaking with is a broker or the actual shipper. Much like researching a contractor or plumber, car shippers can vary from business to business.<br />
Above all else, never feel silly for asking questions. If you&#8217;re uncertain about any items that the shipper addressed, or not addressed, be sure to ask. And, as always, remember that if something seems too good to be true, it likely is.</p>

There are many situations where a sturdy, reliable trailer can get the job done &#8211; especially if the distances are shorter and the weather is cooperative. Our friends at <a title="uShip.com" href="http://uship.com" target="_blank">uShip</a> have compiled the four smart tips listed below that you should always consider when you&#8217;re overseeing shipping via a trailer by yourself.<br />
<em><b>1. Get familiar with your hitch:</b></em> The hitch is the small piece of metal between your truck and the freight it’s pulling, so drivers need to know the ins and outs of their hitches. There are four different classes of trailer hitches, with each level having a different rating and weight threshold. Different hitches will likely vary in size as well, meaning the tow ball mounts will either increase or decrease with each class. While this isn’t new information, truckers must still resist the temptation to use a trailer that’s a different size than their hitch – even if it’s close. Remember, losing a customer’s cargo can not only impact a driver’s pockets, but others on the road as well.<br />
<em><b>2. Don’t push the weight:</b></em> A truck, a hitch and a trailer are all designed to withstand a certain amount of weight, give or take a few pounds. Though there may be a little leeway for hauling a heavy load, it’s dangerous and ill-advised to try and tow too much. Not only are you endangering others on the road, your truck and equipment may suffer as a result, which could impact business in the near future. Heavier loads take more fuel to pull, and putting extra stress on a truck’s frame will only hurt its performance in the long run. As tempting as it is to try and fit a load in one haul, if there’s just too much cargo, make time for an extra trip.<br />
<strong><em>3. Brakes are incredibly important: </em></strong>Most modern-day trailers have the necessary wiring and technology to hook up to a truck’s brake light system. However, if your truck is older and you need to buy a controller, it’s best to make a high-end investment, according to service magazine Popular Mechanics. Cheaper controllers are typically timer-based, which can cause a delay between the actual braking action and the light flashing on the attached trailer. Proportional brake controllers match the trailer brake output to the towed vehicle’s deceleration. At the end of the day, taking the safest measures possible is the best way to go. What’s more, Popular Mechanics recommends drivers adjust the gain on a trailer-brake controller. The trailer shouldn’t feel as if it’s dragging the truck’s performance down. On the other hand, the truck shouldn’t be doing all the braking work either. Striking the right balance will drastically help towing performance.<br />
<em><strong>4. Don’t be a jerk on the road:</strong></em> Hotshot deliveries are typically needed in an expedited manner, so it’s easy for drivers to try and rush to meet a specific deadline. However, regardless of what you’re towing, it’s important to not be overly aggressive. In fact, it’s best practice to give traffic a little extra cushion and brake well in advance so the cargo isn’t jarred loose. The inertia of the trailer may make it more challenging to stop suddenly, which is another thing to keep in mind. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also suggests drivers avoid passing on narrow roads or <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/problems/Equipment/towing/safety_tips.htm" target="_blank">going onto a soft shoulder</a>, the latter of which could lead to control issues.<br />
