								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most popularly bought and sold items on the web are collectables &#8211; sports cards, coins, comic books, and many other lesser known pieces. Like any other highly specialized base of knowledge, there are those who spend years learning the intricacies of what separates top grade collectables from their inferior counterparts. While you may not have the time required to dedicate yourself fully to learning all the ins and outs of your specific hobby, the tips below can help to give you a better understanding of what certain items are viewed as higher quality than others.<br />
<strong><em>Baseball Cards</em></strong><br />
One of the more highly priced collectables sold on ebay has been a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card. While the card in and of itself is rare and valuable, there have been some that sold for a few thousand dollars, while others that sold for tens of thousands of dollars. What&#8217;s the difference? The difference lies in the condition of the card itself. A few simply marks or unintentional creases can make all the difference. For example, the card below on the left was rated as a grade 1 by <a title="Professional Sports Authenticators" href="http://www.psacard.com/Services/PSAGradingStandards" target="_blank">Professional Sports Authenticator</a>, while the other was rated as a grade 5. That four number difference in grading was also the difference between a card that sells for $6,000, and one that sells for over $25,000.<br />

<a href='https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/buying-collectables-online-know-your-grading/attachment/20150602141215/'><img width="150" height="150" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150602141215-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<a href='https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/buying-collectables-online-know-your-grading/attachment/20150602141310/'><img width="150" height="150" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150602141310-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<br />
<strong><em>Coins</em></strong><br />
Similar to the rating scale that PSA has established for sports cards, the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation has created its own rating system to evaluate coins. Based on a scale from 1 to 70, subtle dents of marks on the coin can make the difference between one that is valued at a few dollars, or a few thousand. You can also <a title="NGC Coin Grading Process" href="http://www.ngccoin.com/coin-grading/grading-process/index.aspx#video" target="_blank">watch a video on NGC&#8217;s website</a> to get a better idea of the entire process that goes into grading various types of coins.<br />
<strong><em>Toys and Action Figures</em></strong><br />
An increasingly larger community of collectors have circled back to their childhood and turned the buying and selling of older toys and action figures into big business. This increased interest from collectors has spawned the creation of the <a title="Action Figure Authority Ratings" href="http://www.toygrader.com/grading_information.aspx" target="_blank">Action Figure Authority</a>, a grading and rating authority that specializes just in action figures and other toys. This grading association has established four specific authorities that are further specialized in their areas of expertise &#8211; the Action Figure Authority, Collectable Doll Authority, Die-Cast Authority and Video Game Authority. Each of these authorities will rate any given piece on a scale of 1 to 10, with half and quarter grades being assigned for numbers 7.5 and above.<br />
Regardless of which avenue your favorite hobbies or interests may run, the key to knowing how to buy and sell online is knowledge. While you may not have the time to learn all of the intricacies of your specific interests, knowing the basics of how those items are rated and evaluated is the first step in ensuring that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard as you seek out that perfect find.</p>

Very subtle differences from one collectable to another can drastically alter the overall value of the item, and the market is frequently flooded with forged pieces &#8211; especially during the resurgence of teams or individuals. If sports memorabilia is your game, keeping an eye out for some of the common scams listed below can help you avoid becoming a victim of collectables fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Bloated Quality Rankings</em></strong><br />
Nearly all collectables are ranked on some sort of scale, be it 1 to 10, A through F, or any other combination. Some ranking authorities are always above board and lend an equally critical eye to each piece that collectors submit, but some rating agencies are softer than others. Depending on the type of collectables you&#8217;re shopping for, learn the rating agencies of repute and those that may hand out liberal top scores. Sadly, it&#8217;s not always a case of apples to apples.<br />
<strong><em>Trade Show Only Vendors</em></strong><br />
Memorabilia shows travel the country constantly. Most of the vendors at these shows are above board, but there are always sharks among the guppies. Some of these vendors are really collectors in disguise. In addition to their attempts to low ball any potential purchases, these vendors will often have no ties to the real world. So, if you are able to discern that you&#8217;ve purchased a fake item from one of these show vendors there&#8217;s no possible way for you to follow up or track them down. The best place for any serious collector to shop is a trusted and established brick and mortar collector&#8217;s storefront.<br />
<strong><em>Straight Up Fakes and Forgeries</em></strong><br />
These are the most common scams that any collectors will come across. Faked signatures, artificially aged baseballs and mitts, forged championship rings &#8211; there&#8217;s always a scammer looking to take advantage of rabid fans. The easiest way to protect again these types of scams are to have an established expert in your corner. If you don&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to learning all the ins and outs of what constitutes a forgery find someone who already has that knowledge at the ready.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Upfront</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re buying online through an auction or classifieds site, you should also be using online escrow. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller by holding funds as a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there&#8217;s proof that the item has shipped, or it has even arrived and you&#8217;ve had the chance verify it&#8217;s condition. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
While it&#8217;s impossible to know the mind and reputation of every buyer or seller on the web, keeping an eye out for the common scams listed above can help you head off any bad deals at the pass.<br />

And, like other markets where there&#8217;s money to be had, there are scammers lurking about claiming to sell authentic items that are actually fakes. Naturally, this is one of the major concerns a buyer has when making a purchase.<br />
Even reputable auction websites, <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/10/18/a-safe-way-to-buy-personal-goods-on-ebay-and-craigslist/">such as eBay</a>, can&#8217;t weed out 100% of fraudulent items for being sold as &#8220;authentic.&#8221; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to use PaySAFE&#8217;s online escrow service the next time you purchase a valuable collectible.<br />
As a buyer, PaySAFE not only holds your funds until the transaction is complete, it gives you the ability to authenticate the item before releasing any money. This ensures you&#8217;re buying exactly what you&#8217;re paying for &#8212; protecting you from common frauds, like, for example, the seller switching a certified 1952 Mickey Mantle rookie card with a fake at shipping.<br />
<strong>Authentication made easy</strong><br />
Authentication may seem like a daunting task &#8212; and yes it can take several days to weeks &#8212; but it&#8217;s a necessary step in verifying that what you&#8217;re buying is the real deal, as there are few feelings worse then the ones you experience when you know you&#8217;ve been ripped off.<br />
Luckily, there are several great resources out there to help authenticate and value collectibles such as trading cards, autographs, tickets and ticket stubs as well as gear worn and/or signed by professional athletes like bats, helmets, gloves and more. We recommend <a href="http://www.psacard.com/" target="_blank">Professional Sports Authenticator</a>.<br />
<strong>Trading safely</strong><br />
With PaySAFE, transparency is guaranteed with each transaction thanks to our paperwork-free online tools that allow the buyer and seller to create and upload a purchase agreement, upload photos, exchange messages, track progress and utilize our escrow service for financial security. If you have any questions, contact PaySAFE <a href="http://mailto:support@paysafeescrow.com/">by email</a> or by calling 402.881.7133.<br />
