With the advent of online and remote auctions, there are now several ways for bidders to participate, and a growing number of auction types. To make choosing the right auction for your items easier, below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the most popular types of auctions, and how each style of auction works.<br />
<strong><em>On-Site and Online Live Auctions</em></strong><br />
This type of auction is likely what most people think of when they hear the word auction. Bidding takes place in real time, and is conducted either online or in person. This is also the most straight forward way to buy or sell in an auction setting, as it is simply the person who bids the highest who walks away with the item, and all participants are able to hear each bid as it comes in.<br />
<strong><em>Webcast Auctions</em></strong><br />
Similar to live on-site auctions, these types of auctions are again conducted in real time, but the auctioneer and participants are all joined together via webcast. Lots that are up for bidding are all displayed through a webcast setting, and again, the highest bidder is the one who walks away with each lot.<br />
<strong><em>Sealed Bid Auctions</em></strong><br />
There is a greater amount of secrecy associated with sealed bid auctions as participants are unaware of what their competition is bidding. Bid are submitted to the auctioneer or auction house in sealed envelopes and, as with other auctions, the participant with the highest submitted bid will be awarded the lot.<br />
<strong><em>Timed Online Auctions</em></strong><br />
Time auctions held on sites like ebay are some of the most common web-based auctions. Sometimes created with a reserve amount and sometimes not, bidders have a number of hours, day, or weeks to bid on the lot in question. The only challenge to this type of auction is for bidders to ensure they have the last and highest bid placed before the auction closes.<br />
While there is no hard and fast rule as to what types of items are best suited to each type of auction, it ultimately comes down to how quickly the auctioneer or owner wants to sell their items.

Here are a few tips that every seller or artist should pay attention to when testing the waters of online sales.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Give Up on Offline Marketing</em></strong><br />
Rarely is there such a thing as an all or nothing preposition when it comes to marketing and sales channels. Just because online marketing offers a low cost alternative to maintaining a storefront or attending live auctions doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the only option. Establishing and nurturing in person connections in addition to casting a wider net through the web is a great two pronged attack for any independent artist or dealer.<br />
<strong><em>Social Networking ≠ Social Sales</em></strong><br />
There is a big difference between publicizing your wares through sites like Facebook and Instagram, and driving sales in auctions and classified ads. Sites like <a title="Fine Art on Artnet.com" href="http://artnet.com" target="_blank">Artnet.com</a> and <a title="Proxibid.com" href="http://proxibid.com" target="_blank">Proxibid.com</a> are the places where you&#8217;ll want to drive any traffic from social networking platforms where you advertise your work.<br />
<strong><em>Cast a Wide Net</em></strong><br />
When you&#8217;re first beginning to advertise and sell online you shouldn&#8217;t put all of your eggs in one basket. Creating listings across several websites is a good way to see what circles your buyers may be running in. While it will likely take a bit more time to manage this approach in the beginning you&#8217;ll eventually be able to determine which outlets are the most effective, and which ones can be removed from the mix.<br />
<strong><em>Keep the Information Coming</em></strong><br />
Make a plan and determine how frequently you&#8217;ll be able to contribute to your new online marketing channels. While you won&#8217;t need to dedicate all of your time to maintaining an online presence, it will take time. Scheduling out regular features and content can help you to keep information fresh and appealing without occupying too much of your work time.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
While the online market opens up amazing opportunities, it also opens you up to risks. Protecting your funds and avoiding fraud is paramount, and can be done easily through the use of online escrow services. <a title="Fine Art Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> protects sellers by verifying and holding funds with a neutral third party &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks. Buyers are also protected as funds aren&#8217;t released to the seller until they have proof of shipping, or have given the item a final inspection after arriving.<br />

From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

But if you&#8217;re a buyer who ends up with a vehicle that you suspect to different than advertised, how can you tell for sure? Some of the tips below will provide simple tools to use and common items to check for basic types of vehicle fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Odometer Fraud</em></strong><br />
According to the Consumer Federation of America, nearly 1 in 10 Americans is driving around in a vehicle with an incorrect odometer. Both mechanical and digital odometers can be tampered with somewhat easily, but there are ways to protect against this type of deception. The simplest way is to compare the total mileage listed on the title to the odometer itself. Fraudsters will often attempt to make the title mileage difficult to read through blurring or smudging, but any items that are unclear or unreadable on a title should be a red flag to any potential buyer. You can also check mileage against any maintenance or oil change stickers that may be on the vehicle.<br />
<strong><em>Mechanical or Body Work Fraud</em></strong><br />
Another common type of fraud involves hiding mechanical or body damage. Most often this will include covering up minor things like scratches or surface rust while not disclosing that those items exist. More extreme cases of fraud can involve tampering with or altering mechanical components of the vehicle itself. The best fight against this type of fraud is to have any purchased vehicle properly inspected by a mechanic. Unless you happen to have extensive knowledge about the make or model you&#8217;re purchasing, only a professional will be able to spot the signs of tampering at the mechanical level.<br />
<strong><em>Washing a Title</em></strong><br />
This type of deception is most commonly found after major natural disasters like hurricanes or floods. With these types of disasters vehicles are sometimes given a salvage status due to heavy water damage. Washing the title refers to the practice of dealers or individuals transferring the vehicle to another state or region that doesn&#8217;t recognize that salvage brand. The easiest way to fight this type of fraud is to run a vehicle history report through a company like CarFAX. Companies like CarFAX run a comprehensive report that, more likely than not, will expose this salvage title that the seller may have attempted to hide.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Against Fraud</em></strong><br />
You can also head off any potential fraud at the pass by using an <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. By placing your purchase funds with a neutral third party and crafting your own purchase agreement, you can have the chance to thoroughly inspect any vehicle you intend to buy before clearing the funds for release. Once you know that the vehicle you&#8217;re considering is what it&#8217;s supposed to be you can then release the funds to the seller, keeping your purchase money safe and sound.<br />

Websites like MachineTools.com have become a go-to resource for business owners who are looking to buy and sell machinery to a wider audience beyond their local auction houses. These online machinery auction sites bring together savvy buyers and sellers who need equipment or capital to continue growing their businesses, and are now nearly industry standard places to price out and complete machinery and equipment transactions.<br />
<strong><em>Know the Website</em></strong><br />
While reputable sites like <a href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> and <a href="http://machinesbook.com" target="_blank">MachinesBook.com</a> have gone to painstaking lengths to provide excellent service and security to their users, there are always scam or fraud sites that will spring up in the wake of a successful business model. Be sure to do some background research on the website you&#8217;re looking to buy or sell through. Often times, it can be as simple as calling the website&#8217;s customer service 800-number, or sending an email to their support team. If you get prompt, well-written responses you&#8217;re one step ahead of the game. Many fraudulent sites won&#8217;t even list a customer assistance phone line or will simply funnel emails to a noreply email address that&#8217;s never checked.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve closed your auction. Now that you&#8217;ve locked in a buyer or won your bid, it&#8217;s imperative to keep open lines of communication between yourself and the other party. If we see transactions struggle or fall apart, most times it&#8217;s due to a simple breakdown in communication &#8211; problems or questions that could easily have been solved through a quick phone call or email. Being prompt and responsive to any buyer or seller as to your expectations can alleviate most problems from the start.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
To help put buyers and sellers at ease, consider the use of <a title="PaySAFE Commercial Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a>. Even used machinery and equipment carry will carry heavier price tags, so online escrow companies like PaySAFE can add that extra layer of protection that both buyers and sellers are looking for. Buyers are protected as their funds are not released until there is proof of shipping, or the item has arrived at its final location. Sellers are protected as purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks &#8211; and are wired directly into their back account of choice upon release.<br />
Ultimately, buying and selling online comes down to a little extra legwork. If you&#8217;re willing to put in a little bit more time to research the auction site itself and work with buyers and sellers from across the country (or the globe), there can be great benefit for both parties.

Everyone gets together, items come up for bid, bidders raise their paddles or placards to indicate they would like to bid, winner bidder pays and everyone goes home happy. But do online auctions operate in the same manner? Like any hobby or business practice, there are those who push the boundaries and will try to take advantage to get an inside track or an extra buck, so what should you look out for at both in-person and online auctions?<br />
<strong><em>Low-Balled Prices</em></strong><br />
Both online and in-person auctions will sometimes intentionally low ball their prices. Knowing that the item(s) in question will be highly sought after, the auction house or private seller will intentionally place the reserve price significantly lower than it should be. This tactic will often drive a considerable uptick in interest for the item and can create a hot bed for potential bidders. More bidders = more bids, which drives the auction item quickly above and beyond the original reserve price.<br />
<strong><em>Shills</em></strong><br />
Shills are a group of sellers or individuals who have decided to work together to drive up the prices of certain items. Simply put, one person puts and item up for bid and a few others will drive up the price by placing empty bids until an unsuspecting party comes in to the equation. Once the legitimate bidder places a bid topping the others, the seller&#8217;s partners drop out of the bidding and leave the genuine bidder holding the bag. Running shills in prohibited in most auction houses, but online it can be much more difficult to detect when or if there are shills running in the background. The easiest way to avoid being taken is to simply set your own personal limit on the item, and to walk away if bidding passes that dollar amount. It can be tough to let that dream purchase go, but it&#8217;s better than being stuck paying for an overpriced item.<br />
<strong><em>Trust Your Eyes</em></strong><br />
Many people are drawn to auctions by brand names. Luxury brands draw in bidders who are seeking luxury brand names, but with auctions you can sometimes find amazing deals if you&#8217;re willing to look past the brand. Sometimes in-person auctions will have a separate section with lower priced goods. While these items won&#8217;t draw the crowds, you can easily find quality among the lesser known designers and brands. Do a little research of your own on some unfamiliar or non-household brand names and you could be rewarded with great quality at an even better price point.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Find out if the auction you&#8217;re participating in will allow you to pay via an online escrow service. <a title="PaySAFE Online Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> protects both the buyer and the seller by verifying and hold purchase funds with a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds are only released when there is proof that the item has shipped or has arrived at its final destination. Sellers and auction houses are protected as all purchase funds are verified upfront &#8211; eliminating the risk of insufficient funds, fraudulent checks, and credit card chargebacks.<br />
Sometimes the best protection you can have in any auction setting is to trust your gut and set ground rules for yourself. If you know exactly how much you want or can afford to spend, going above that limit should happen in only rare circumstances. Trusting your gut is also important. Often times if a deal or situation seems too good to be true, it usually is.<br />

You won your bid on eBay or negotiated a successful price on ClassicCars.com, GunBroker.com or one of the many other consumer marketplaces around the web. Now that you&#8217;ve secured your prize, what&#8217;s next? Have you decided how to pay the seller? Was shipping part of the deal you negotiated? Closing the auction or negotiating a price is just the start&#8230; now you have to close the transaction safely and securely.<br />
<strong><em>Agree on Payment</em></strong><br />
Many auctions sites will list ways in which the seller is agreeable to being paid, but don&#8217;t actually provide a payment process. If the seller is agreeable or if you&#8217;re unable to pickup the item in person, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow services</a> are an excellent way to protect both the buyer and seller through the payment and shipping process &#8211; especially if both parties are separated by large distances and are relative unknowns to each other.<br />
While wiring funds directly may seem like a good idea, escrow allows for funds to be held securely until there is proof that the purchased items has either shipped or arrived safely at its final destination. It also protects the seller from the risk of insufficient funds or credit card charge backs by verifying and holding the total purchase price securely in a third party escrow account.<br />
<strong><em>Price &amp; Schedule Shipping</em></strong><br />
Shipping costs will vary wildly depending on what you&#8217;ve purchased. Shipping a car or RV is very different from simply packaging a watch or cell phone, so be sure to shop around when it comes to selecting a shipper. Companies like <a href="http://www.uship.com/vehicles/?r=2824374" target="_blank">uShip.com</a> can help arrange shipping for any number of items, while others &#8211; like <a title="Montway Vehicle Shipping" href="http://montway.com" target="_blank">Montway.com</a> &#8211; specialize in verticals like vehicle shipping or freight. Once the shipping has been squared away, it&#8217;s important to communicate and tracking or receipt numbers to both parties.<br />
<strong><em>Pay Your Tab</em></strong><br />
Once you have the payment method and shipping all lined up, there&#8217;s nothing left to do but pull the trigger! Keeping open lines of communication an documenting messages throughout the entire process is imperative. Payment and document tracking platforms like PaySAFE can be a real life saver as all communications and financial processes are time-stamped and logged in a transaction history that both parties can access during and after the transaction itself.<br />

From robust, image-heavy platforms like ebay to stripped down and simple sites like Craigslist, <a title="Online Marketplaces: The Future of Luxury and High-Dollar Transactions?" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/05/01/online-marketplaces-the-future-of-luxury-and-high-dollar-transactions/" target="_blank">online auctions and classifieds are more accessible than ever</a>. But like any new skill or experience, if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the landscape it can be a bit daunting to create a listing or buy an item. To help get your feet wet, below we&#8217;ve compile a list of helpful tips for any first time online auction participant. While it doesn&#8217;t get into the nitty gritty of listings or bidding, this list should help ensure you&#8217;re not flying blind for your first auction experience.<br />
<strong><em>Examine the Listing Closely</em></strong><br />
There are tens of thousands of sellers on internet, and each one will have a slightly different style to their listings. Some sellers are meticulous in listing every detail about each item they place on the block, while others will only provide a bare bones description. If there&#8217;s something missing from the description of an item you&#8217;d like to bid on, message the seller. If it&#8217;s a reasonable request most sellers will answer any additional questions you might have. If you&#8217;re the one listing the item, be prepared for potential buyers to ask additional questions. If you&#8217;re unable or unwilling to provide answers, you may want to reconsider your listing.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Auction Types</em></strong><br />
Not all online auctions are true auctions. For example, ebay has listings that don&#8217;t involve bidding at all. The seller simply sets a price for the item and, through the listing creation process, will select options showing whether or not the seller is willing to negotiate on price. Those listings that do have a traditional auction bidding process will also list the time remaining for users to place bids. Be aware that bidding will get fast and furious during the closing minutes of most auctions &#8211; especially if the item in question is rare or highly sought after.<br />
<strong><em>Check Comparables</em></strong><br />
Just because an item is rare or has a set price doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t shop around. See what similar items in a similar condition are selling for around the web and then crosscheck with your preferred listing. If the pricing is too high or, more importantly, way too low you may want to pass. <a title="9 Ways to Protect Yourself From Internet Fraud" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/10/31/9-ways-to-protect-yourself-from-internet-fraud/" target="_blank">Items listed dramatically under their accepted or appraised value are often indicative of scams.</a> If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
Once you close on a listing, be sure to keep an open line of communication with the other party. Whether you&#8217;re the buyer or the seller, responding promptly to emails and phone calls can make all the difference when trying to arrange for shipping and payment. Keeping a record of your communication is also important should any type of dispute arise.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Payment Options</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re new to an auction site, be sure to carefully review the accepted forms of payment. While some sites will have a checkout process integrated into their auction listings, many will simply display the types of payment the seller prefers and leave the decision up to you. For high dollar value items, <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> is a great method for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially if the two parties are relative unknowns to each other or are separated be great distances.<br />
If you&#8217;re new to auctions or to a specific platform never be afraid to ask questions. Taking a few minutes to chat with a customer service rep or posting a note to your social media network of choice can save you quite a bit of time and hassle.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jerry, who lives in Missouri, found a beautiful 1964 Dodge Polara 500 Convertible for sale on an online classifieds website from a seller in Pennsylvania. After exchanging a few emails and phone calls, Jerry new he wanted the car, but was still hesitant at the idea of simply sending a check to a relative stranger, especially when the price tag of the Polara was nearly $50,000. He wanted to make sure everything about the classic car met the description the seller provided &#8212; to a T. That&#8217;s why he turned to PaySAFE, which provided peace of mind that his money was secure until he received the car.<br />
The seller was also happy to use PaySAFE, as both parties needed to agree to the details of the transaction before it was officially completed, as PaySAFE gets financial commitment from the buyer upfront, making sure the seller gets paid on time, protecting him from payment fraud.<br />
Both Jerry and the seller in Pennsylvania found that setting up the transaction was easy using PaySAFE&#8217;s paperwork-free online tools. After they both agreed to PaySAFE&#8217;s terms of use, the transaction was ready to be completed.<br />

As the transaction unfolded, Jerry and the seller were able to exchange messages via PaySAFE’s private communication board. Once all the details were agreed upon by both parties, the transaction was complete — and until this final point, no money was exchanged. Once again, PaySAFE leveled the playing field for both the buyer and seller.<br />
Now Jerry is showing off his slick Polara convertible to his friends at the local car shows. Meanwhile, the seller is happy to have received the payment in a secure and timely manner, and is putting the money into restoring more classic cars for future sales.<br />
