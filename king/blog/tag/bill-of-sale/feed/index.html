								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Taking these steps will help you.</h3>
<p>In a market rife with  fraud and product misrepresentation, buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Buyers want confidence that the vehicle is what the seller says it is and that they will not be the victims of fraud. Here are five steps that car buyers can take to minimize risk in .</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Inspection:</u></strong> You need to verify that the car is in the same condition as described in the ad.  You can have the seller take the car to a dealer close to them to do an inspection or there are independent inspection companies like <a href="http://wegolook.com">WeGoLook.com</a> which will dispatch an inspector to photograph or video the car.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping:</span></strong> Do not under estimate how much it will cost to transport the car to you or how complicated the process of finding a transporter is! There are companies like <a href="http://uship.com">uShip.com</a> that will help narrow your search options and give you a range of prices to choose from.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase agreement:</span></strong>  Set exact expectations up front with a purchase agreement.  This is often over looked for online purchases. You want to detail in writing, signed by both parties, what exactly is and isn&#8217;t included in the sale and the condition of the item. It is better to agree over whether the winter tires are included or are not now than 2 weeks later after the sale is done.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfer purchase price:</strong> </span> This is the key point of terror for you, the buyer. The realization that you are going to wire tens of thousands of dollars cross country to a person you do not know for a car you have not touched and HOPE it shows up at your place in 10 days.  Luckily there is a company,<a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow"> PaySAFEescrow.com</a>, that handles this (and all 5 of these items) for you. Pay SAFE Escrow, Inc is an online escrow company that provides an easy to follow online workflow to properly document, track communication and transfer money safely.  PaySAFE holds the purchase amount in escrow until the transaction is complete than PaySAFE releases the funds directly to the seller.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Documentation:</strong></span> Just when you thought you were done, there is more paperwork.  You, the buyer, will need to register the car in your state and transfer ownership.  You will need the seller to sign a Bill of Sale and properly sign the back of the car title to transfer ownership into your name. Make sure the seller has all this documentation completed before the seller receives the funds.</li>
</ol>

However, there is one form of paperwork that really shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as quite a burden: a purchase agreement.<br />
We all want to believe the best in the people with which we interact, and this includes those that we buy from and sell to. But the harsh reality is that we live in a very litigious time and in a very litigious country where, often times, the only things that can save our hides are the documents we have to support one side of a story or another. Because of this, purchase agreements are a must have anytime you buy or sell an item of significant value.<br />
<em><strong>Purchase Agreement Basics</strong></em><br />
While purchase agreements don&#8217;t have to be overly complex, there are definitely a few items that you should always be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of both parties entering into the agreement</li>
<li>Item(s) being sold and any warrantees or representations, or if the item is being sold &#8216;as-is&#8217;</li>
<li>Total purchase price</li>
<li>Current location and condition of the item being sold</li>
<li>Details as to how payment will be completed &#8211; especially if there are multiple payments or payment is contingent on items like repairs, completed projects or inspections.</li>
<li>Jurisdiction of disputes</li>
<li>Signatures &#8211; including dates if possible &#8211; for all parties involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to peace of mind, purchase agreements are required a number of different scenarios. Interstate commerce requires purchase agreements to be included with any shipments. <a title="International Shipping Tips &amp; Tricks" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/12/international-shipping-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">International commerce</a> requires purchase agreements in order to pass through customs. The government also requires a purchase agreement for taxation purposes.<br />
Aside from the number of entities that require this type of paperwork, written agreements allow for both the buyer and seller to plan for a worst case scenario. While most transactions go through with little friction, planning for the worst will ensure that both parties can rest easy knowing that a plan of action is in place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/postitquestions.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1757" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/postitquestions.jpg?w=179" alt="postitquestions" width="179" height="300" /></a>Paperwork is usually the least interesting part of buying or selling property, but from a legal perspective it&#8217;s often the most important part of any transaction. We&#8217;ve already discussed the <a title="The Importance of a Purchase Agreement" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/20/the-importance-of-a-purchase-agreement/" target="_blank">importance of a purchase agreement</a>, but a Bill of Sale is something a little different.<br />
<strong><em>What is a Bill of Sale Used for?</em></strong><br />
In its simplest form a Bill of Sale is simply a document that shows who sold an item, who purchased that item, and the dollar amount for which that item was purchased. For the seller, this paperwork is mostly ceremonial and is used primarily for record keeping to show that they no longer own the item in question. But for buyers, a Bill of Sale is much more important. In many states, new vehicle owners cannot complete insurance or registration/licensing forms without a Bill of Sale. These documents are also often used to determine any state or local taxes that buyers must pay in conjunction with their registration and licensing.<br />
<strong><em>What Do I Need to Include on a Bill of Sale?</em></strong><br />
While the required information on a Bill of Sale will vary slightly from state to state, all will include required information like the name and address of the buyer and seller, the sale amount of whatever was sold, and any registration, VIN or plate numbers specific to the item being sold. Additional information will vary depending on whether it was a car, boat, camper or motorcycle that was bought, but most state DMVs have instructions on their websites as to what details need to be included. You can also <a title="Free Bill of Sale from PaySAFE Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/billofsale/wizard" target="_blank">fill out a free bill of sale</a> on our site that includes a section for notary public stamping if it&#8217;s required in your state.<br />
<strong><em>Who&#8217;s Responsible for the Bill of Sale?</em></strong><br />
While either party can draft a Bill of Sale, it never hurts to come with a blank or partially completed form of your own in case the other party forgets &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re the buyer. You may even want to bring multiple copies so that each person can have two copies for their records. If you happen to be buying from a dealer, the dealership will draft up all the necessary paperwork for you.<br />
Again, paperwork and the details required on a Bill of Sale will vary slightly from state to state, so be sure to <a title="Find Your Local DMV" href="http://www.dmv.org/dmv-office-finder.php" target="_blank">consult your local DMV</a> to ensure that both parties are aware of what&#8217;s needed. If the requirements are in any way unclear, err on the side of gathering too much information from both parties. This can save you the time and hassle of trying to track down the buyer or seller after the sale is complete.</p>

Naturally, this can be quite the headache, so we&#8217;ve put together this DIY Guide to Paperwork to help you make sure everything&#8217;s signed and in order, ensuring the deal is closed legally and without a hitch.<br />
<em><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Check in with the DMV</strong></em><br />
Contact your state <a href="http://www.dmv.org" target="_blank">Department of Motor Vehicles</a> to find out what documents are needed in order to sell a car, boat or RV in your area. If the sale is conducted across state lines, contact the DMV in both states. Note that many local agencies have guides on their websites to help you through the process.<br />
<em><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Creating a bill of sale</strong></em><br />
What all to include in the bill of sale &#8212; sometimes called a purchase agreement &#8212; varies slightly from the type of vehicle or vessel you&#8217;re selling. If you&#8217;re having trouble creating one from scratch, there are plenty of online templates that can be used or easily adapted.<br />
For cars and RVs, the bill of sale should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Purchase date</li>
<li>Description (make, model and any upgrades)</li>
<li>Odometer reading</li>
<li>VIN number</li>
<li>Name/address of buyer and seller</li>
<li>Driver&#8217;s license number of buyer/seller</li>
<li>Seller&#8217;s statement of vehicle ownership</li>
<li>Seller&#8217;s statement that there ARE outstanding debts against the vehicle (if applicable)</li>
<li>Seller&#8217;s statement that there are no outstanding debts against the vehicle</li>
<li>Signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>For boats, the bill of sale is very similar to that of a car, and should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Purchase date</li>
<li>Description and hull number</li>
<li>Signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Title (and lien)</strong></em><br />
Titles are issued individually by state, and are very similar for cars, boats and RVs. Every time a motorized vehicle or vessel exchanges owners, a new title must be created or updated. Make sure the title is filled out entirely, front to back, with all appropriate names and signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s) &#8212; including a lienholder, if applicable. The exact specifics of issuing a title varies by state so, again, check with your local DMV.<br />
If the original title is missing, a replacement title must be acquired. The DMV has <a href="http://www.dmv.org/replacing-a-lost-title.php" target="_blank">a fantastic state-by-state guide</a> to this process, which starts with filling out an application for a replacement title. In some states, you can complete this step entirely online, while in others it requires an in-person visit to the DMV or simply mailing in an application.<br />
The title must include info about an outstanding loan on the vehicle/vessel, as the buyer won&#8217;t be able to fully register it until the loan is cleared. Likewise, if the seller is paying off a lien with the money from the sale, the buyer should contact the lienholder to make sure the money will be used for its intended purpose, getting proof that the loan will be paid off. In some cases, it&#8217;s required that the loan be paid off before the sale, so check with the lienholder to acquire the appropriate paperwork in this scenario. When a lien is involved, a lien release must be attached to the vehicle&#8217;s/vessel&#8217;s title if the county treasurer hasn&#8217;t yet released the lien.<br />
Here&#8217;s a list of to-dos when the title exchanges hands:</p>
<ul>
<li>For cars and RVs, vehicle plates should be returned to the previous owner</li>
<li>In most cases, the buyer must complete an application for the title and registration within 30 days of the purchase</li>
<li>Include the completed bill of sale with the completed title</li>
<li>Buyer submits the completed application to the county treasurer and pays appropriate fees</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Other paperwork</strong></em><br />
Aside from the bill of sale and title, the seller should hand over any warranty cards, maintenance records and any other paperwork before the final sale of the vehicle/vessel. The owner should also cancel his or her insurance once the sale is final.<br />
Some boats are purchased with a trailer, which, depending on your state, may require a separate set of paperwork to acquire a title. Your local DMV will likely have a checklist of all the necessary information.<br />
While usually not required, notarizing all of the paperwork to validate signatures is a good idea.<br />
