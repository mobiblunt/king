								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years phishing schemes, ransomware, and outright hacking have become extremely profitable for scammers. Because of the prevalence of online transactions both large and small, and the interconnectivity of both mobile and desktop devices, online thieves have been making a good living off of those who are unprepared. The infographic below, put together by <a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/infographics/how_hackers_earn_money" target="_blank">Kaspersky Labs</a>, shows just why there has been such a large jump in online attacks &#8211; they work.<br />

<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
One of the easiest ways to protect your finances in online transactions is to use an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. Buyers are protect as purchase funds are held with a neutral third party, and aren&#8217;t released until there&#8217;s proof that items have shipped or have even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds, and credit card chargebacks.<br />

However, with the increased convenience and opportunity, there’s also an increase in risk.<br />
Scams and fraud are very real concerns when it comes to making any purchase on the web. This risk increases greatly when you’re talking about transactions involving thousands of dollars and sometimes-stressful documentation. The best way to ensure that you aren’t a victim of a scam is to protect yourself from the start using an <a title="Vehicle Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">escrow service.</a><br />
An escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third-party and usually associated with high-value purchases. They can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction, including buying/selling a vehicle.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Buyers</h2>
<p>As a buyer, one of the biggest risks you run into is misrepresentation. You think you’ve found the holy grail of classic cars only to find out that, after the vehicle arrives, you’ve been taken for a ride. Escrow services help to mitigate that risk almost entirely. As a buyer, all of your purchase funds are held with a neutral third-party and are only released as specific checkpoints in your agreement are reached.<br />
So, if the seller’s vehicle arrives and isn’t what was advertised, you have the opportunity to return the vehicle to the seller and be refunded the full purchase price.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Sellers</h2>
<p>From the seller’s perspective, the greatest risk is that the buyer doesn’t pay the agreed amount. Escrow services remove that issue from the equation by verifying the funds–in full–up front. You won’t have to worry about cashier’s checks being lost in the mail or notice of insufficient funds days after your vehicle has left your driveway.<br />
Escrow also allows for the scheduling of smaller payments to be released to you, as needed, to cover things like transportation or repair costs. These scheduled payments will be outlined in the agreement.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Use an Escrow Service?</h2>
<p>Most online escrow services also include a workflow that allows for the easy uploading of any documentation required by the parties involved in the sale, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspection forms from mechanics.</li>
<li>Bills of lading.</li>
<li>Photos of the vehicle to verify condition or progress of repairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these items can be easily uploaded to bolster the seller’s claim as to the vehicle’s condition and to ease the mind of any nervous buyer. This type of record is even more important if the sale is taking place between residents of different states or countries.<br />
The best part about using an online escrow service for your vehicle purchase is having all of these services done by the one company and all in one place. Online escrow platforms allow for documentation, transportation arrangements, and purchase funds to be held securely in one easy-to-access location with a full communication history available to either party at any time.<br />
When dealing with a buyer or seller unknown to you, using an escrow service gives you the best protection.</p>

Be it quicker customer response times, shorter closing timelines, or overall cost savings, businesses are constantly using various tools to tweak a little bit here and there in efforts to nudge the needle just a bit higher. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> is one such tool at the disposal of any business buying and selling high dollar items &#8211; and can be especially valuable to businesses with international partners.<br />
<strong><em>Simple Workflow</em></strong><br />
Escrow companies like PaySAFE can provide a simple, easy-to-use workflow for creating and managing transactions. From the simple items like the buyer&#8217;s and seller&#8217;s names and total transaction amount to complex purchase agreements and heavy documentation, a simple workflow and history can save time and money while minimizing any potential misunderstandings. Online escrow services also do an excellent job of prompting either party when there are items that require their attention, like the approval of purchase agreements, uploading of required documentation, or approvals for the release of funds.<br />
<em><strong>Lock In Sales</strong></em><br />
Online escrow can be a great way to separate window shoppers from serious buyers. As all purchase funds are verified and held up front, sellers can rest easily knowing that the total transaction amount is held securely, and is simply awaiting the completion of their agreement. Buyers can also rest easy as funds aren&#8217;t released without their approval. This could be at the time of shipment, after arrival, or at various checkpoints throughout the process.<br />
<strong><em>International Transactions</em></strong><br />
Buying and selling between two individuals or companies across the globe can be challenging. Escrow services like PaySAFE can help ease that tension much as they do with domestic transactions. With significant cost savings over more traditional payment methods &#8211; like Letters of Credit &#8211; escrow can provide all the security with none of the hassle. Often times escrow can be the most cost effective way to on-board new partnerships, or to transact with other businesses that may not have access to large lines of credit.<br />
<strong><em>Lightning Fast</em></strong><br />
There isn&#8217;t a business out there that isn&#8217;t looking for some sort of a competitive edge, and most often that edge relies on speed. Traditional payment methods like letters of credit can easily get bogged down with paperwork and compliance issues. Escrow works much more quickly, and can often go from funding to disbursement in the matter of only a few days. Compared to the weeks, or even months that can be attached to applying for lines of credit or constructing letters of credit, escrow offers a significant advantage for businesses looking for the ability to turn on a dime.<br />

You won your bid on eBay or negotiated a successful price on ClassicCars.com, GunBroker.com or one of the many other consumer marketplaces around the web. Now that you&#8217;ve secured your prize, what&#8217;s next? Have you decided how to pay the seller? Was shipping part of the deal you negotiated? Closing the auction or negotiating a price is just the start&#8230; now you have to close the transaction safely and securely.<br />
<strong><em>Agree on Payment</em></strong><br />
Many auctions sites will list ways in which the seller is agreeable to being paid, but don&#8217;t actually provide a payment process. If the seller is agreeable or if you&#8217;re unable to pickup the item in person, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow services</a> are an excellent way to protect both the buyer and seller through the payment and shipping process &#8211; especially if both parties are separated by large distances and are relative unknowns to each other.<br />
While wiring funds directly may seem like a good idea, escrow allows for funds to be held securely until there is proof that the purchased items has either shipped or arrived safely at its final destination. It also protects the seller from the risk of insufficient funds or credit card charge backs by verifying and holding the total purchase price securely in a third party escrow account.<br />
<strong><em>Price &amp; Schedule Shipping</em></strong><br />
Shipping costs will vary wildly depending on what you&#8217;ve purchased. Shipping a car or RV is very different from simply packaging a watch or cell phone, so be sure to shop around when it comes to selecting a shipper. Companies like <a href="http://www.uship.com/vehicles/?r=2824374" target="_blank">uShip.com</a> can help arrange shipping for any number of items, while others &#8211; like <a title="Montway Vehicle Shipping" href="http://montway.com" target="_blank">Montway.com</a> &#8211; specialize in verticals like vehicle shipping or freight. Once the shipping has been squared away, it&#8217;s important to communicate and tracking or receipt numbers to both parties.<br />
<strong><em>Pay Your Tab</em></strong><br />
Once you have the payment method and shipping all lined up, there&#8217;s nothing left to do but pull the trigger! Keeping open lines of communication an documenting messages throughout the entire process is imperative. Payment and document tracking platforms like PaySAFE can be a real life saver as all communications and financial processes are time-stamped and logged in a transaction history that both parties can access during and after the transaction itself.<br />

In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

As opportunities have opened up for small and mid-sized businesses to become larger players in their respective industries, the old approaches to payment and credit have not evolved at the same pace. Below, we&#8217;ll explore some of the long-standing types of payment systems still in place and how they stack up when compared with <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow services</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Open Credit<br />
</span></em></strong>This type of payment process is great for long-standing business relationships where the time spent underwriting the requesting party can be justified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers typically have 30, 60 or 90 days to clear outstanding balances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Good for consistent, repeat business between two parties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Underwriting for another party is time consuming and requires a knowledgeable staff to execute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Not often smart for first-time business transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses with questionable credit can be denied open lines of credit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Open lines require accounts receivable attention and can be viewed as negative credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Long term spot rates for foreign currencies is often required as transaction can take months to close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Cash-In-Advance</em></strong><br />
Just like it sounds, this type of payment is much more secure for the seller than the buyer as all the purchase funds are transferred before the purchased goods arrive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Sellers have all purchase funds up front</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Funds are out of the buyer’s account almost immediately &#8211; eliminates the need to monitor open credit lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Transferred funds are completely out of the buyer’s hands leaving that business to simply rely on purchase agreements to guarantee arrival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Burden is now entirely on the seller to execute the agreement in a timely manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Requires a larger amount of liquid assets to be available for buyers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Letters of Credit</strong></em><br />
A longstanding form of payment, <a title="Letters of Credit on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_of_credit" target="_blank">Letters of Credit</a> are a double-edged sword for both parties when it comes to B2B transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The buyer has the full good standing of the bank behind their offer of payment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Bank acts as an intermediary between two unknown parties and can assist in settling disputes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Letters of Credit can be costly &#8211; fees are often in the area of 2% of the total transaction amount and are collected from both parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Fees associated with Letters of Credit can often make them cost prohibitive for transactions of less than $50,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Modifications to terms may also cause disruption in the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Discrepancies in documents sent by the seller can potentially cause the issuing bank to void the document entirely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Escrow</em></strong><br />
<a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Escrow services</a> tend to offer a more balanced approach when it comes to security for both the buyer and the seller in addition to shorter closing periods.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Buyer’s funds are verified up front and held by a neutral party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">No underwriting is required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Partial payments or refunds are easily executed as needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Little to no attention required from accounts receivable teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Spot rate for transactions only needs to be estimated for 24-48 hours from time of payment request to payment deposit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>While not as intensive as open credit, escrow does require some monitoring by both parties to ensure that any documentation or approval deadlines are met.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a number of the above options have great applicability for specific types of transactions, escrow is really the only category that has the flexibility and cost benefits to work quickly and efficiently for both long-standing and new business relationships.
