While the condition of a vehicle may be more readily apparent, there are many nuances that a seasoned buyer will know to look for. The same can be said for firearms. Organizations like the <a href="http://www.nramuseum.org/gun-info-research/what%27s-my-gun-worth.aspx" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a> have tried to make the process a little easier for both buyers and sellers by establishing widely accepted rating scales for both modern and collector firearms. Familiarizing yourself with the scales listed below can be a big time saver, and give both buyers and sellers a realistic idea of what a firearm is worth.<br />
<strong><em>Modern Gun Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New/Perfect</strong>: This condition level looks like it&#8217;s never left the factory packaging.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: The firearm may have been used a few times, but there is zero sign of wear and tear. Wood, metal and bluing are in perfect condition except at the muzzle or any sharp edges.</li>
<li><strong>Very good</strong>: Perfect working condition, but with no noticeable wear on working components. No corrosion or pitting present.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Safe working condition. Minor wear is likely present on working components, but still no corrosion or pitting.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Safe working condition, but well worn. Replacement of some components may be needed. No rust should be present, but some minor corrosion is not uncommon at this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Antique/Collector Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory New</strong>: 100% original parts and finish. Perfect working condition inside and out.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: This level still has all the original parts and 80%+ of the original finish. Any stamping, lettering or design on wood or metal is still crisp and clear. The wood should also unmarred and the bore in great condition.</li>
<li><strong>Fine</strong>: All original parts, but with 30%+ or so of the original finishing. Letter and stamping should also still be in near perfect condition, but dings or slight scratches on wood surfaces are present.</li>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: All original parts are present, but less than 30% of the original finish remains. All metal surfaces are original and still have crisp, sharp edges. Stenciling or lettering is clear, but wood surfaces have more noticeable scratches or dings. Bore condition is also less important at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Repair or replacement of minor parts. Rust may be present, but is smooth with minimal to no pitting and possible re-bluing of the finish. Letters and numbers are legible, and scratches or dents in wood surfaces may have been refinished or repaired.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Major components may have been replaced at this level of conditioning, and minor parts may still need repairing or replacement. Light pitting is present over most of the firearm, and rust is more noticeable. Finishing has likely been cleaned vigorously or noticeably re-blued. Sharp edges have been worn down or rounded, and lettering or stencils may be partially worn away. The key is to be in decent working order, or can be made into that condition with a little effort.</li>
<li>Poor: Significant work would need to be done to bring this type of collector firearm back into working condition. Replacement and repair of both major and minor parts, significant pitting and rust, scratched surfaces, completely worn away printing and stenciling, and complete inoperability are calling cards of this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other commonly used ratings systems include the <em>Blue Book of Gun Values</em>, based on the original finish system of rating, and <em>The Standard Catalog of Firearms</em>, which uses a system similar to the NRA rating terms, but with significantly different qualifications as to which items fall into which category.<br />

While these sites do an excellent job of monitoring and vetting users, if you&#8217;re new to online auctions and classified listings the process can be a bit daunting. The tips below can be a great help for buyers new to the online firearms world, and make sure that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard when you&#8217;ve found a used rifle that meets your needs.<br />
<strong><em>Ask Questions</em></strong><br />
Many times new buyers can be bashful when it comes to asking questions for sellers. You should never feel bad about asking too many questions. Veteran sellers will have all kinds of information at their disposal for the items they&#8217;re selling, and more often than not are happy to provide whatever they can. You should also ask questions of any customer service reps that the auction or classified site my provide. If things aren&#8217;t clearly spelled out from either the seller or the website&#8217;s FAQ, ask away!<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s a 50/50 shot as to whether or not a given website will have a secure checkout process. Even if the site does provide a checkout service, you should strongly consider an <a title="Gun Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service for any larger purchase. Online escrow works to protect you AND the seller. Buyers are protected as all funds are held with a neutral third party until there is proof that the rifle has shipped, or has even arrived at your chosen FFL holder for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as your purchase funds are verified and held upfront, completely removing the seller&#8217;s chances of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
<strong><em>Secure a Quality Inspection</em></strong><br />
Unless you happen to be an expert gunsmith you&#8217;ll want to line up an inspection. Companies like WeGoLook.com can schedule an inspector to visit the rifle in question and report back to you what they find. Depending on the specifications of the rifle, you may also want to build in time for you to inspect the rifle yourself once it arrives &#8211; especially if there are any custom components that the previous owner has added themselves.<br />
Ultimately, as the buyer the onus is on you to ensure that what you&#8217;re buying is what you think it is. While any legitimate seller will do their best to work with you on price, shipping and inspections, it&#8217;s up to you as the buyer to educate yourself as thoroughly as possibly on the processes and rifle itself.<br />

As ecommerce as exploded in popularity over the last decade nearly everything has found a niche retailer or two in the online space. Buying and selling firearms online took a bit longer to gain traction simply due to the nature of the items being sold, but now antique and collector firearms enthusiasts have numerous reputable websites at their disposal. Below we&#8217;ve compiled a listing of some of the top websites for <a title="Firearms Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">buying and selling firearms online</a>. While each has its own unique design and slightly different processes, each site will have a number of similarities.<br />
<a title="GunBroker.com" href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>GunBroker.com</em></strong></a><br />
Our friends at GunBroker.com have been in business for 15 years, and have built a reputation for quality listings and customer service. With listings for handguns, rifles, collectable firearms, ammunition, and numerous other categories, GunBroker.com is truly a one-stop shop for firearms, hunting, fishing and sport shooting enthusiasts. The site&#8217;s search functionality also makes it easy to sort outÂ listings based on manufacturer, caliber, model or any other specified criteria.<br />
<a title="Armslist.com" href="http://armslist.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Armslist.com</em></strong></a><br />
With hundreds of listings categorized first by state, Armslist.com compiles classified listings based on six major categories: firearms, firearms accessories, outdoor gear, other items, events, and services. You can also narrow listings further by selecting a city or region within your state of choice.<br />
<a title="Gunocracy.com" href="http://gunocracy.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Gunocracy.com</em></strong></a><br />
About as straight forward of a firearms website as can be, Gunocracy.com is focused around a more visual search for firearms and accessories. Breaking listings into four main categories &#8211; handguns, rifles, shot guns, and accessories &#8211; users can then specify price ranges, calibers, barrel lengths and manufacturers to narrow down available items from hundreds of listings. Gunocracy.com&#8217;s <a title="GunUp the Magazine - Gunocracy.com" href="http://www.gunupthemagazine.com/" target="_blank">GunUp</a> blog section and Q&amp;A forums also make it easy to connect with other users within the site.<br />
<a title="GunsAmerica.com" href="http://gunsamerica.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>GunsAmerica.com</em></strong></a><br />
Similar search and sorting functions are found on GunsAmerica.com as with the previous sites we&#8217;ve listed, but a much deeper selection of articles and featured gun reviews gives GunsAmerica a slightly different feel. The site also has a clearly labeled section for dealers, and keeps a history of recent classified listings and auctions that you&#8217;ve viewed &#8211; which makes finding recently viewed items even easier.<br />
You should also takes steps to secure your funds when buying through online classified sites like those listed above. <a title="Firearms Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies like PaySAFE work to protect both the buyer and seller by simply holding funds until there is proof that the item has shipped or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are equally protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; eliminating the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
Whichever firearms website you may choose, be sure to closely read all the rules and regulations when it comes to creating a listing or bidding on auctions. While most sites will have similar functionality, it&#8217;s the little differences that can sometimes cause issues if you are actively listing or shopping on multiple firearms websites.<br />
