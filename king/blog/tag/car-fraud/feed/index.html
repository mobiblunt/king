								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2199 size-medium" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flooded-street.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" />Here&#8217;s fair warning when buying a new or used car after a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy &#8212; hundreds of thousands of cars have been recently submerged or flooded and <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/flooded-car-totalled" target="_blank">effectively totaled</a>, yet many of these will end up for sale in car lots and on online marketplaces disguised as undamaged new or used vehicles. And not only should those living in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and surrounding areas worry, these cars are easy to ship and will likely end up for sale all over the country.<br />
Being submerged in water can cause a number of problems for a car, affecting brakes, clutch, accelerator, electrical system, transmission, drivetrain and the engine as well as fuel and power steering systems. Unless dirt and other contaminants are completely removed from all of these vital components (which is not an easy, let alone cheap task), the car will suffer from increased wear and premature failure.<br />
AAA offers the following tips on how to recognize a flood-damaged car.<br />
<strong>Use your senses.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs of water damage, including water lines on headlights and elsewhere.</li>
<li>Do a thorough inspection by checking for mud, mildew or other residue under carpets, on the trunk floor and other enclosed areas like door panels and the gas tank, paying close attention to tiny hard-to-clean crevices.</li>
<li>Any unusual smells, such as dampness or mold, are red flags.</li>
<li>Turn on the engine to make sure it sounds as it should.</li>
<li>During a test drive, make sure the car &#8220;feels&#8221; right.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check under the dash.</strong><br />
Underneath the dashboard is a particularly hard area to clean. A dishonest seller looking to quickly flip the car will likely clean the rest of the car, but skip this part.<br />
<iframe width="940" height="705" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy0BuwjGfJg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<strong>Get the car&#8217;s vehicle history report.</strong><br />
Obtaining the car&#8217;s history via <a href="http://www.carfax.com/car_buying/" target="_blank">CARFAX</a> will reveal if it&#8217;s been in a major accident, such as a flood or fire. You can also check the VIN in the <a href="http://www.nicb.org/" target="_blank">National Insurance Crime Bureau</a> database of vehicles involved in recent hurricanes. This service is free-of-charge, but keep in mind it doesn’t cover all flood-damaged vehicles.<br />
<strong>Have it inspected.</strong><br />
Any car should be inspected by a quality repair facility before it&#8217;s purchased. There are plenty of mechanics out there who are trained in handling flood-damaged vehicles, so don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for a flood inspection.<br />
<strong>Use PaySAFE to avoid fraud.</strong><br />
Using PaySAFE to complete a transaction is also a great way to avoid fraud. Acting as a neutral third party escrow service, PaySAFE offers the buyer (and seller) safe, secure and easy-to-use tools to close the deal. The buyer and the seller exchange no money until all the terms of the transaction are approved.<br />

But if you&#8217;re a buyer who ends up with a vehicle that you suspect to different than advertised, how can you tell for sure? Some of the tips below will provide simple tools to use and common items to check for basic types of vehicle fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Odometer Fraud</em></strong><br />
According to the Consumer Federation of America, nearly 1 in 10 Americans is driving around in a vehicle with an incorrect odometer. Both mechanical and digital odometers can be tampered with somewhat easily, but there are ways to protect against this type of deception. The simplest way is to compare the total mileage listed on the title to the odometer itself. Fraudsters will often attempt to make the title mileage difficult to read through blurring or smudging, but any items that are unclear or unreadable on a title should be a red flag to any potential buyer. You can also check mileage against any maintenance or oil change stickers that may be on the vehicle.<br />
<strong><em>Mechanical or Body Work Fraud</em></strong><br />
Another common type of fraud involves hiding mechanical or body damage. Most often this will include covering up minor things like scratches or surface rust while not disclosing that those items exist. More extreme cases of fraud can involve tampering with or altering mechanical components of the vehicle itself. The best fight against this type of fraud is to have any purchased vehicle properly inspected by a mechanic. Unless you happen to have extensive knowledge about the make or model you&#8217;re purchasing, only a professional will be able to spot the signs of tampering at the mechanical level.<br />
<strong><em>Washing a Title</em></strong><br />
This type of deception is most commonly found after major natural disasters like hurricanes or floods. With these types of disasters vehicles are sometimes given a salvage status due to heavy water damage. Washing the title refers to the practice of dealers or individuals transferring the vehicle to another state or region that doesn&#8217;t recognize that salvage brand. The easiest way to fight this type of fraud is to run a vehicle history report through a company like CarFAX. Companies like CarFAX run a comprehensive report that, more likely than not, will expose this salvage title that the seller may have attempted to hide.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Against Fraud</em></strong><br />
You can also head off any potential fraud at the pass by using an <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. By placing your purchase funds with a neutral third party and crafting your own purchase agreement, you can have the chance to thoroughly inspect any vehicle you intend to buy before clearing the funds for release. Once you know that the vehicle you&#8217;re considering is what it&#8217;s supposed to be you can then release the funds to the seller, keeping your purchase money safe and sound.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When buying an automobile online or through a classified ad in a newspaper, fraud is a real threat, as many well-meaning buyers all-too-often fall victim to scammers. This being the case, it&#8217;s important to take the proper measures to protect yourself. The following tips will help you make sure you avoid fraudulent transactions. For starters, just being aware that you could be taken advantage of is a great first step to avoiding scam artists.<br />
Using PaySAFE to complete a transaction is also a great way to avoid fraud. Acting as a neutral third party escrow service, PaySAFE offers both buyer and seller safe, secure and easy-to-use tools to close the deal. No money is exchanged until all the terms of the transaction are approved by the buyer and the seller.<br />
<strong>Use common sense</strong><br />
Double checking everything and using common sense will go a long way in protecting yourself from scammers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know the market value.</strong> Unless you&#8217;re buying from a friend or family member, you should expect to pay the market value for the car you&#8217;re interesting in purchasing. That said, be very suspicious if a vehicle is priced much lower than market value &#8212; it&#8217;s most likely bait from a scammer to lure you in.</li>
<li><strong>Match the seller to owner.</strong> Obtaining a history report provides all kinds of useful information, like whether or not the seller&#8217;s name is on the title (it should be), if the car&#8217;s had any accidents reported to authorities and if the car&#8217;s ever been reported stolen, salvaged or damaged. <a href="http://www.carfax.com/entry.cfx">CARFAX</a> is an easy way to obtain a history report.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect the car.</strong> Take the car to a trusted mechanic of your choice for an inspection. If the car is out-of-state, hire a <a href="http://testdrivetech.net/paysafe/" target="_blank">professional inspection service</a>. NEVER let the seller take the car to a mechanic of their choice.</li>
<li><strong>Match VIN number on car to VIN number on title.</strong> If these two numbers match, you&#8217;re clear to (cautiously) proceed with the transaction. If they don&#8217;t match, get an explanation from the seller, as you might be dealing with a stolen car.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the car isn&#8217;t flood-damaged.</strong> If possible, the mechanic who conducts the inspection should also be trained in handling flood-damaged vehicles. (Warning signs include water lines and mud or mildew under carpets, on the trunk floor and in enclosed areas such as door panels and the gas tank.) Checking the title may reveal if the car&#8217;s been salvaged, however not all states require this. Last, check the VIN in the <a href="http://www.nicb.org/" target="_blank">National Insurance Crime Bureau</a> database of vehicles involved in recent hurricanes. This service is free-of-charge, but keep in mind it doesn&#8217;t cover all flood-damaged vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm the seller&#8217;s contact info.</strong> Verify the seller&#8217;s street address and phone number before sending any payment (for this, it&#8217;s preferred to use PaySAFE escrow service). Also, if the seller lives overseas, be very cautious &#8212; and always use PaySAFE&#8217;s escrow service.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of too much email communication.</strong> Using email is fine for the most part, just be sure to NEVER send any sensitive personal or financial information &#8212; like your social security number, credit card number or checking account number &#8212; by email. It&#8217;s also a red flag if the seller refuses to talk to you on phone.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a detailed receipt.</strong> The receipt should include if the car is being sold with a warranty or &#8220;as is.&#8221; Also, it should state any/all accessories that are included. Using PaySAFE allows you to describe in detail all warranties and expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Get the car&#8217;s title.</strong> Before you purchase the vehicle, make sure you know what&#8217;s required in your state to properly transfer the title. Your local DMV has plenty of info.</li>
</ul>
