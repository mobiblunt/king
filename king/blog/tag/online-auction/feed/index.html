Online buyers also have the advantage of shopping through millions of products from the comfort of their couch or office chair. While there is tremendous opportunity for both parties, how can you safely complete a transaction with someone who many not be just across town, but across the globe? Following the tips below can help to ensure that whether you&#8217;re buying or selling, you&#8217;ll always be safe.<br />
<strong><em>Keep Things Disposable</em></strong><br />
Many online auction and classified websites have their own email system where buyers and sellers can communicate within the platform. However, not all sites offer this type of functionality. If you don&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to communicate with the other party through the host sites system, consider creating a non-specific and easily deleted email account. This allows you to keep your regular emails from family and friends separated from any communications with unknown buyers and sellers. That insulation layer can also provide protection against scammers who may try to hack your email.<br />
<strong><em>Go Beyond Email</em></strong><br />
Communication through email is incredibly convenient, but it can also provide scammers a great place to hide. If you&#8217;re comfortable, attempt a phone conversation with the other party. Not only does this allow you to establish that there is a real person on the other end of the transaction, but it can be a great way to iron out details that may not translate well in an email message.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Consider using an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow is great for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially when steep price tags are involved. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs. Buyers are also protected because funds are held securely with a neutral third party, and generally aren&#8217;t released until there is proof that the item has shipped or has even arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
It not difficult to believe that any seller will always try to present their item in the best possible light. Some sellers will take things a bit too far and attempt to conceal damaged items. While you may be tempted to take the seller at their word you should always consider an inspection. Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will setup a time for one of their lookers to visit the item you&#8217;re considering, and document the actual condition of the item. Depending on your requirements, these inspectors can even shoot video, or perform custom inspections to make sure that all of your concerns are addressed.<br />
When it call comes down to it, most people are better at recognizing a potential scam than they realize. If you ever get the feeling that something just isn&#8217;t right, or that it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. In that situation you should never feel badly about simply walking away from the deal.<br />

Because these items generally have high sticker prices for first-time owners, buying used watches and jewelry online can be a significant cost savings &#8211; especially if your tastes are for luxury brands. Because of the high value attached to used watches and jewelry, it behooves any buyer or seller to seek out financial protections when <a title="Safely buying collectibles online" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/11/29/safely-buying-collectibles-online/" target="_blank">selling through auction sites or online classifieds</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Buying watches and jewelry online can save you lots of cash, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that used luxury items are cheap. Even used items can easily have price tags equivalent to older used cars. So, if you&#8217;re not able to see the auction item in person how can you guarantee your not getting a raw deal? Online escrow services are a great way to help mitigate risk for both the buyer AND seller. Sellers know that the funds are good as the moneyÂ is verified upfront and held with a neutral third party. Buyers are secured knowing that they&#8217;ll have proof of shipping, or the item will have already arrived before funds are released to the seller.<br />
<strong><em>Ship It Properly</em></strong><br />
Most traditional shipping companies like UPS or Fedex will only insure packages up to a certain dollar amount &#8211; generally in the neighborhood of $1,000. USPS will allow you to purchase extra coverage for up to $5,000. If multiple items are being shipped to the same address, it may be smart to separate the items into two or three packages to avoid a potential catastrophic loss. Also avoid using any labeling that blatantly calls attention to the fact that there is jewelry inside the package. For additional security, be sure to ship via certified mail or any type of shipping that requires a signature for the package to be delivered.<br />
<strong><em>Get It Appraised</em></strong><br />
While everyone wants to believe the best in people, it never hurts to get a second opinion. Requesting a 24-48 period to have items inspected before processing payment can be a life saver if you suspect you may be a victim of product fraud. Also be sure to ask for any prior appraisal information that the seller may be able to provide. If no such paperwork exists it should raise a red flag regardless of the item&#8217;s price point. Ultimately, building in time for an inspection puts the buyer&#8217;s mind at ease and shows that the seller stands behind their statements. Should the item be returned for one reason or another, it&#8217;s also important for sellers to have the item re-appraised. It&#8217;s not an uncommon scam to have buyers return and item only to have swapped out the genuine gemstone or watch with a fake.<br />
When it comes right down to it, you should trust your gut. If the price of an item seems too good to be true, it often times is exactly that.
