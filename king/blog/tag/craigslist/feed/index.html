Because these items generally have high sticker prices for first-time owners, buying used watches and jewelry online can be a significant cost savings &#8211; especially if your tastes are for luxury brands. Because of the high value attached to used watches and jewelry, it behooves any buyer or seller to seek out financial protections when <a title="Safely buying collectibles online" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/11/29/safely-buying-collectibles-online/" target="_blank">selling through auction sites or online classifieds</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Buying watches and jewelry online can save you lots of cash, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that used luxury items are cheap. Even used items can easily have price tags equivalent to older used cars. So, if you&#8217;re not able to see the auction item in person how can you guarantee your not getting a raw deal? Online escrow services are a great way to help mitigate risk for both the buyer AND seller. Sellers know that the funds are good as the moneyÂ is verified upfront and held with a neutral third party. Buyers are secured knowing that they&#8217;ll have proof of shipping, or the item will have already arrived before funds are released to the seller.<br />
<strong><em>Ship It Properly</em></strong><br />
Most traditional shipping companies like UPS or Fedex will only insure packages up to a certain dollar amount &#8211; generally in the neighborhood of $1,000. USPS will allow you to purchase extra coverage for up to $5,000. If multiple items are being shipped to the same address, it may be smart to separate the items into two or three packages to avoid a potential catastrophic loss. Also avoid using any labeling that blatantly calls attention to the fact that there is jewelry inside the package. For additional security, be sure to ship via certified mail or any type of shipping that requires a signature for the package to be delivered.<br />
<strong><em>Get It Appraised</em></strong><br />
While everyone wants to believe the best in people, it never hurts to get a second opinion. Requesting a 24-48 period to have items inspected before processing payment can be a life saver if you suspect you may be a victim of product fraud. Also be sure to ask for any prior appraisal information that the seller may be able to provide. If no such paperwork exists it should raise a red flag regardless of the item&#8217;s price point. Ultimately, building in time for an inspection puts the buyer&#8217;s mind at ease and shows that the seller stands behind their statements. Should the item be returned for one reason or another, it&#8217;s also important for sellers to have the item re-appraised. It&#8217;s not an uncommon scam to have buyers return and item only to have swapped out the genuine gemstone or watch with a fake.<br />
When it comes right down to it, you should trust your gut. If the price of an item seems too good to be true, it often times is exactly that.

In addition to larger online marketplaces like <a href="http://classiccars.com" target="_blank">ClassicCars.com</a> or <a href="http://autotrader.com" target="_blank">AutoTrader.com</a>, buyers and sellers are flocking to Craigslist as the replacement for their local classifieds. While the postings are virtually endless, the anonymity that Craigslist provides has raised concerns as to the safety and validity surrounding the site&#8217;s listing. Granted, the vast majority of the items posted to Craigslist are on the up and up, the short guide below should provide some additional tips for buyers and sellers new to Craigslist.<br />
<strong><em>Read Between the Lines</em></strong><br />
Taking cues from the listing itself can be a big help. Does the posting seem aggressive? Is it riddled with spelling errors or mismatched and incorrect information? The way a posting is written can give you clues as to the buyer&#8217;s or seller&#8217;s personality. Much like human resources professionals can quickly weed out resumes based on sketchy information, so can a savvy car buyer.<br />
<strong><em>Ask for Paperwork</em></strong><br />
In the back and forth that takes place on Craigslist before you agree to purchase the vehicle, ask about paperwork. This should go without saying with ANY vehicle purchase, but again, the anonymity of the site will often lead to vague descriptions that don&#8217;t provide near the depth of information that other car listing sites will provide. If you agree to inspect the vehicle and paperwork in person, be sure to go over the documents with a fine toothed comb.<br />
<strong><em>Bring a Friend and Keep it Public</em></strong><br />
The vast majority of Craigslist purchases take place face-to-face. This is the element of Craigslist purchases that makes some buyers and sellers the most apprehensive. As the saying goes, there&#8217;s strength in numbers, so bringing a friend along for the ride can&#8217;t hurt. Numbers can also come in handy by meeting in a public place. Parking lots of busy department stores, malls or restaurants can also add a layer of security and reassurance for both you and the other party.<br />
<strong><em>Take a Lap</em></strong><br />
Before you walk right up to the prospective vehicle or buyer, consider driving or walking a lap at a distance. Taking a lap gives you a chance to double check that the vehicle at least appears as advertised, and also give the scene a quick survey. If everything looks as it should you can proceed as planned. If your warm-up lap doesn&#8217;t look right you can call the buyer or seller and let them know that you&#8217;ve decided to pass on the transaction.<br />
<em><strong>Weed Out Window Shoppers</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re selling a popular make or model you&#8217;ll likely be dealing with a number of offers and requests for information. You can vet serious buyers by requesting that ALL buyers be willing to use an escrow service. <a title="PaySAFE Vehicle Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> actually work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller. Sellers know that the buyer is serious as all purchase funds are verified up front before the vehicle leaves their possession. Buyers know that their funds are held securely with a third party until they can verify that the item in question is as it was advertised.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet has enabled con artists to deceive more people than ever before. <a href="http://backgroundcheck.org/">BackgroundCheck.org</a>Â published these statistics related to internet scams and fraud:</p>
<div>1. From 2005 to 2009, internet scam complaints rose from 100,000 per year to nearly 300,000 per year.<br />
2. The monetary loss of scam complaints easily exceeds $300 million per year.</div>
<div>3. Top 5 internet scams with the most complaints:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>4.4% &#8211; Identity theft</li>
<li>13.2% &#8211; FBI-related scams</li>
<li>9.8% &#8211; Miscellaneous fraud</li>
<li>9.1% &#8211; Advance fee fraud</li>
<li>8.6% &#8211; Spam</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Men report 25% higher monetary losses related to internet spam than women.<br />
5. In 2010, individuals in the 60 years or older group reported higher amounts of monetary loss from internet scams than any other group.<br />
6. The 3 most commons locations for internet scams to originate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>65.9% &#8211; United States</li>
<li>10.4% &#8211; United Kingdom</li>
<li>3.1% &#8211; China</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams">Craigslist</a> is a great resource for finding a purchase and a great place to get scammed. Â Here&#8217;s some advice from them to avoid fraud:</div>
<ul>
<li>Meet the seller in person and inspect the goods personally if at all possible. In the event that you&#8217;re unable to inspect the item yourself, be sure to request an inspection from a third party expert.</li>
<li>Never use Western Union or Moneygram to send payment prior to receiving the item. Use only traceable money transfer options.</li>
<li>If it is too good to be true&#8230;..it is a scam.</li>
<li>Never send money out of the country. There are scams that specifically target military personnel and their families that ask for such payments.</li>
<li>Always talk to someone via phone and write down the number. Most scams are done only via email and never give out phone numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there is no foolproof way to prevent fraud, awareness is the best defense so be sure to use a third party, online escrow service likeÂ <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud">PaySAFE<sup>Â®</sup></a>Â when making important Â purchases. These types of platforms allow both the buyer and seller to negotiate unique agreement terms for each transaction, and then keep track of all communication during the escrow process. There are also various means of identity verification and document tracking that can be great lines of protection for both parties.<a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud"><br />
</a><br />
No matter how you choose to complete your next online purchase, be sure to do some legwork to ensure that the other party involved is who they say they are. And, as always, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s always risk involved when buying goods from websites like eBay and Craigslist. The fear of most buyers is rooted in the fact that they are buying something, oftentimes expensive, from a complete stranger.

A safe and easy way to trade personal goods, PaySAFEÂ acts as a neutral third party, providing trust both the buyer and seller can build on.

Using PaySAFE as an online closing tableÂ <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/09/27/trust-and-integrity-with-paysafe/">encourages trust and provides integrity</a> for both buyer and seller because no money exchanges hands until all the details of the transaction are agreed upon by both parties.

And with PaySAFE, transparency is guaranteed with each transaction thanks to our paperwork free online tools that allow the buyer and seller to create and upload a purchase agreement, upload photos, exchange messages, track progress and utilize our escrow service for financial security.<br />
<strong>The PaySAFE way</strong><br />
PaySAFE is an ideal way to trade personal goods after initially agreeing to buy from websites like Craigslist and eBay. By using PaySAFE, trust and integrity always go hand in hand. If you have any questions, contact PaySAFEÂ <a href="http://mailto:support@paysafeescrow.com/">by email</a>Â or by calling 402.881.7133.<br />
