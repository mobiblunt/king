								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png"><img id="i-1206" class=" wp-image alignright" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png?w=487" alt="Image" width="204" height="204" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever purchased a home &#8211; or even looked into the process behind purchasing a home &#8211; you&#8217;ve probably seen the term &#8216;escrow&#8217; quite a bit. In the most basic layman&#8217;s terms, an escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third party; usually associated with high-value purchases.</p>
<p>But <a title="Escrow account on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow_account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow accounts</a> aren&#8217;t unique to real estate. These types of accounts can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction.</p>
<p>For example, say you were looking to purchase a classic car or a boat for your family vacations. Once you&#8217;ve located the pre-owned vehicle you want, you now are stuck dealing with a relative stranger for a purchase north of $10,000. How do you hold the seller accountable and ensure that you don&#8217;t fall victim to an online scam? Often <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online escrow</a> accounts help to fill that gray area between a buyer and seller who are unknown to each other.</p>
<h5>How Escrow Works</h5>
<p>As a neutral third party, the escrow company works to keep honest people honest and ensure that both parties can complete the transaction with much greater confidence than a money order or personal check. The buyer can transfer in the funds for the purchase knowing that it will be held in trust until they give the green light. The seller knows that the funds are available as soon as they provide the vehicle or goods to the buyer. The escrow company also has the ability to release partial funds to help with things like transportation or repair costs prior to the buyer receiving their purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, escrow accounts have greater use than real estate transactions. Anytime there are buyers and sellers looking for an extra layer of security in their deals, online escrow accounts are a great place to start.<br />
Have you ever used an online escrow company outside of real estate purchases? What did you find beneficial or difficult?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/cow-closeup.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image alignright" id="i-1471" alt="Image" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/cow-closeup.jpg?w=414" width="414" height="275" /></a>The internet is bringing together cattle buyers and sellers from across the country and the globe as well.  No longer is your distribution network limited by your local sales barn or the state fair. Producers as demanding high pricing for the cattle that meet higher standards of genetics or quality.  Buyers also want to <a title="Private Treaty Livestock Sales with PaySAFE Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/livestock-escrow" target="_blank">purchase livestock</a> for their seed stock program or restaurant.</p>
<p>Sales completed outside of auctions are referred to as Private treaty sales. Private treaty sales are negotiated directly between the buyer and seller, and are generally single transactions. But before you start a new marketing campaign based entirely around private treaty, know that direct sales have their pros and cons. Producers considering private treaty as a marketing and sales channel need to research the best practices for opening up new markets and creating an efficient workflow.<br />
<em><strong>Advantages to Private Treaty</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Seller:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Custom Marketing: The seller has significant control over presentation of their livestock. Sellers can point out positive aspects of livestock and talk up the outstanding features of their animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Showcase Quality/Breed:  Showcase your herd’s genetics, origin and/or unique characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Expanded Markets: Attracting a large audience to spur buyer competition is the burden of the prospective seller when using private treaty. Print advertisements or trade associations and trade papers, word of mouth, internet marketing, media, and other promotional efforts may be needed to attract customers and capture their attention and drive sales. Buyer contact lists should be maintained for follow-up with customers to generate repeat business and positive word of mouth about customer’s experiences with the operation.  Customer service reps may also be needed for answering phone calls from prospective customers and returning emails with additional information in a timely and correct manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Creating a reputable Brand: Over time private treaty sales help producers build the reputations of their operations. Buyers not only view the livestock, but they also get to see the facilities and other aspects of the operation to get a more complete picture of the operation. Open conversations allow sellers and buyers to develop valuable and long-term business relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Custom Terms: Private treaty allows sellers to be flexible in creating a sales contract that meets everyone&#8217;s needs. A private treaty transaction can have any terms and conditions as long as both parties agree. The buyer can negotiate certain specifications, and the seller has the option of passing up a customer who is not willing to agree to certain terms in the hopes of a later buyer doing so. The seller has even more leverage in this process when the product is unique and in high demand. Under these circumstances, premiums can be realized. Those premiums can be worth it if other traditional broker fees are nonexistent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Beef Origin:  Private treaty sales allow for the acquisition of cattle directly from a ranch. Cattle purchased straight from the ranch may undergo less stress and disease exposure than cattle shipped to third-party feedlots or other intermediaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Beef Quality: The buyer can visit the ranch or  ask questions of the seller directly to learn about the herd’s health, nutrition, and other management practices used with a group of cattle so that better decisions can be made on how to transition and manage the cattle on the buyer’s operation after the sale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pricing: The buyer and seller can use information from their discussions to better arrive at a fair market price, because more information is potentially transferred with the cattle. Although other marketing channels may provide commonly requested information about cattle for sale, private treaty sales allow for direct conversations between the seller and buyer with the opportunity to exchange additional, specific information about each grouping. Basically, the buyer can ask detailed questions about the cattle, and the seller has a chance to share detailed information to add value and address any buyer concerns.<br />
<strong><em>Drawbacks to Private Treaty</em></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are different business aspects of Private treaty sales that may not make them the transaction choice for every buyer or seller. For best results, people entering into private treaty sales need to have sound marketing knowledge about the ideal audience for their stock. Parties should also know the current market conditions, prices and qualities of competing cattle. Understanding the positives and negatives of their competition, they then need to determine fair market values for their cattle. This often requires a detailed knowledge of genetics, conformation, and disposition for each animal. Your herd management program information should be readily available for buyers to assess.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Negotiation skills:  Both parties in private treaty sales should be ready to openly discuss pricing. The buyer must have a good idea of what they want and what price consideration will be given for bulk purchasing. Private treaty sales are not publicly reported on a wide scale, so extra effort is required to determine a fair market value.  Educated buyers and sellers know the market and easily come to a fair market value when the facts come to light. How delivery and payment will be handled are other items that must be well defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Open Book dealing:  The seller should be prepared to answer any relevant questions the buyer may ask during the negotiation process as well as after the sale. Some concerns may be reasonable and legitimate, but the seller must also be ready to deal with unreasonable claims seeking to take advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Documentation and Payment:  By cutting out the auction you have also cut out the neutral third party that supplies documentation of the sale and helps transfer funds between each party. The seller need to be ready to create a purchase agreement and deliver all appropriate information for a bill of sale. Risk of payment collection by the seller and product misrepresentation is a real threat.  Services like PaySAFE Escrow, Inc. (<a href="http://www.paysafeescrow.com">www.PaySAFEescrow.com</a>) provide online escrow services to protect both parties and keep everyone honest.  The escrow company collects the full purchase price upfront, so the sale is locked in and the seller knows the money is good. The funds stay in Escrow with PaySAFE until the Buyer confirms that the sales conditions have been met. With escrow, both parties are protected and the funds are never refunded or paid to the seller without both parties approval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">All of this preparation takes careful thought and time on the parts of both the seller and the buyer.</p>
<p><em><strong>New markets = More profit</strong></em><br />
New online marketplaces are changing the aspect of livestock selling.  Every industry evolves and demands new business practices to compete.  These markets offer tremendous potential for cattlemen who are willing to invest the necessary effort into making it a profitable marketing channel for their business.</p>

In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

Not only do you have to hone your bargaining skills as you would when working with dealer, you&#8217;ll also likely need to secure the full purchase price up front and complete some paperwork that the dealer would normally complete on your behalf. So, when you&#8217;re looking at buying a car from a private seller be sure to pay close attention to the tips below.<br />
<strong><em>Verify the Vehicle</em></strong><br />
While we often want to assume the best in others it&#8217;s important to do some background work. If you&#8217;ve already found the car you want to buy you&#8217;ll want to call and confirm that the ad is legitimate. Scams and fraudulent ads are often placed by those who only want to communicate through email. If the private seller&#8217;s phone number is listed it&#8217;s worth a quick call to confirm that there&#8217;s a real person on the other end of the line.<br />
<strong><em>Vehicle Inspection</em></strong><br />
Buying from a private seller means you&#8217;ll also need to try and secure a vehicle inspection. While the seller may swear up and down that their car is in perfect, road-ready condition, you&#8217;ll want to ensure that a neutral third party inspects the vehicle for you if you&#8217;re unable to be there in person. There are a number of vehicle inspection companies like <a title="InspectMyRide.com" href="http://inspectmyride.com">InspectMyRide.com</a> or <a title="RoadReadyCertified.com" href="http://roadreadycertified.com">RoadReadyCertified.com</a> that will send a certified inspector to the seller&#8217;s location and provide both parties with a comprehensive vehicle inspection report.<br />
<strong><em>Clear the Title</em></strong><br />
When you&#8217;re buying a car from a private seller, the responsibility falls on you to ensure that the vehicle is free of and liens or loans. While the seller should disclose this information, a simple comparison of the registration and title to the VIN will not only tell you if there is still a lien on the vehicle, but also allow you a chance to make sure all the paperwork matches up as it should.<br />
<em><strong>Paperwork Round Up</strong></em><br />
Buying a car from a private seller means that you now get to play the roll of paperwork clerk as well as the buyer. As mentioned above, you&#8217;ll need to gather a copy of the title, registration and any other supporting documentation that may be required by the state you live in &#8211; all for tax purposes.<br />
<em><strong>Protect Your Purchase with Escrow</strong></em><br />
While buying a car from a private seller can be a significant cost savings, you&#8217;ll still want to protect your purchase funds. Private sellers and buyers can both benefit by using an escrow service, which acts as a neutral third party to hold the full purchase price until the purchase agreement is completed. With escrow, the buyer&#8217;s funds are verified up front to avoid non-payment and sellers no longer have to worry about misrepresentation or mailing checks. Click for more information about <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Vehicle Escrow Services" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">vehicle escrow</a> and escrow services.<br />
Regardless of how you find your dream vehicle, remember that working with a private seller, in many ways, is no different that working with a dealer. While you may not have the financing options or quantity of vehicles to choose from, a private seller is working to get as much money out of their vehicle as possible. However, arming yourself with the above tips is a great way to ensure that you have enough information in your arsenal to negotiate and close a sale like a pro.</p>
