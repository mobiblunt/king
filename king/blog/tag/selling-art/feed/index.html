Some of the world&#8217;s greatest masterpieces like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel were <a title="Commissioned Art on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_(art)" target="_blank">commissioned art</a> projects. Even today, artwork is commissioned for a wide variety of reasons. Perhaps the greater portion of commissioned art is what is called work-for-hire in the language of intellectual property. This means that an artist is employed by an individual to create art for a specific purpose. The terms of that employment usually dictate that the employer owns all rights to the work created.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Artists need to get a clear understanding of what the client wants and expects and be upfront about you are able to do. Remember that producing a work of art on commission for another party is a relationship and the key to successfully working on commission is your ability to be flexible and communicate with whomever hires you.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A commission relationship only succeeds when you respond effectively to the other party&#8217;s concerns, requests, and needs. Checkout <a href="http://www.caku-art.com" target="_blank">this blog</a> which outlines some realistic terms and expectations when entering into a commissioned project. It&#8217;s also smart to use a neutral, third-party online escrow service like <a title="PaySAFEescrow.com" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal/welcome">paysafeescrow.com</a> to create a safe and secure contract that will please all parties. These types of platforms provide buyers and sellers  with a convenient one-stop location to create, negotiate and close trades with financial protection. Online escrow services also allow the artist and client to set a timeline, be clear about how the work will be picked up, shipped, and who is liable for damage.</div>
