<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/5-key-decisions-to-make-before-buying-a-used-car-sight-unseen/">5 key steps to take before buying a used car sight unseen</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.paysafeescrow.com">PaySAFE</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Taking these steps will help you.</h3>
<p>In a market rife with  fraud and product misrepresentation, buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Buyers want confidence that the vehicle is what the seller says it is and that they will not be the victims of fraud. Here are five steps that car buyers can take to minimize risk in .</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Inspection:</u></strong> You need to verify that the car is in the same condition as described in the ad.  You can have the seller take the car to a dealer close to them to do an inspection or there are independent inspection companies like <a href="http://wegolook.com">WeGoLook.com</a> which will dispatch an inspector to photograph or video the car.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping:</span></strong> Do not under estimate how much it will cost to transport the car to you or how complicated the process of finding a transporter is! There are companies like <a href="http://uship.com">uShip.com</a> that will help narrow your search options and give you a range of prices to choose from.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase agreement:</span></strong>  Set exact expectations up front with a purchase agreement.  This is often over looked for online purchases. You want to detail in writing, signed by both parties, what exactly is and isn&#8217;t included in the sale and the condition of the item. It is better to agree over whether the winter tires are included or are not now than 2 weeks later after the sale is done.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfer purchase price:</strong> </span> This is the key point of terror for you, the buyer. The realization that you are going to wire tens of thousands of dollars cross country to a person you do not know for a car you have not touched and HOPE it shows up at your place in 10 days.  Luckily there is a company,<a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow"> PaySAFEescrow.com</a>, that handles this (and all 5 of these items) for you. Pay SAFE Escrow, Inc is an online escrow company that provides an easy to follow online workflow to properly document, track communication and transfer money safely.  PaySAFE holds the purchase amount in escrow until the transaction is complete than PaySAFE releases the funds directly to the seller.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Documentation:</strong></span> Just when you thought you were done, there is more paperwork.  You, the buyer, will need to register the car in your state and transfer ownership.  You will need the seller to sign a Bill of Sale and properly sign the back of the car title to transfer ownership into your name. Make sure the seller has all this documentation completed before the seller receives the funds.</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png"><img id="i-1206" class=" wp-image alignright" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png?w=487" alt="Image" width="204" height="204" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever purchased a home &#8211; or even looked into the process behind purchasing a home &#8211; you&#8217;ve probably seen the term &#8216;escrow&#8217; quite a bit. In the most basic layman&#8217;s terms, an escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third party; usually associated with high-value purchases.</p>
<p>But <a title="Escrow account on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow_account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow accounts</a> aren&#8217;t unique to real estate. These types of accounts can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction.</p>
<p>For example, say you were looking to purchase a classic car or a boat for your family vacations. Once you&#8217;ve located the pre-owned vehicle you want, you now are stuck dealing with a relative stranger for a purchase north of $10,000. How do you hold the seller accountable and ensure that you don&#8217;t fall victim to an online scam? Often <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online escrow</a> accounts help to fill that gray area between a buyer and seller who are unknown to each other.</p>
<h5>How Escrow Works</h5>
<p>As a neutral third party, the escrow company works to keep honest people honest and ensure that both parties can complete the transaction with much greater confidence than a money order or personal check. The buyer can transfer in the funds for the purchase knowing that it will be held in trust until they give the green light. The seller knows that the funds are available as soon as they provide the vehicle or goods to the buyer. The escrow company also has the ability to release partial funds to help with things like transportation or repair costs prior to the buyer receiving their purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, escrow accounts have greater use than real estate transactions. Anytime there are buyers and sellers looking for an extra layer of security in their deals, online escrow accounts are a great place to start.<br />
Have you ever used an online escrow company outside of real estate purchases? What did you find beneficial or difficult?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

However, with the increased convenience and opportunity, there’s also an increase in risk.<br />
Scams and fraud are very real concerns when it comes to making any purchase on the web. This risk increases greatly when you’re talking about transactions involving thousands of dollars and sometimes-stressful documentation. The best way to ensure that you aren’t a victim of a scam is to protect yourself from the start using an <a title="Vehicle Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">escrow service.</a><br />
An escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third-party and usually associated with high-value purchases. They can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction, including buying/selling a vehicle.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Buyers</h2>
<p>As a buyer, one of the biggest risks you run into is misrepresentation. You think you’ve found the holy grail of classic cars only to find out that, after the vehicle arrives, you’ve been taken for a ride. Escrow services help to mitigate that risk almost entirely. As a buyer, all of your purchase funds are held with a neutral third-party and are only released as specific checkpoints in your agreement are reached.<br />
So, if the seller’s vehicle arrives and isn’t what was advertised, you have the opportunity to return the vehicle to the seller and be refunded the full purchase price.</p>
<h2>Benefits to Sellers</h2>
<p>From the seller’s perspective, the greatest risk is that the buyer doesn’t pay the agreed amount. Escrow services remove that issue from the equation by verifying the funds–in full–up front. You won’t have to worry about cashier’s checks being lost in the mail or notice of insufficient funds days after your vehicle has left your driveway.<br />
Escrow also allows for the scheduling of smaller payments to be released to you, as needed, to cover things like transportation or repair costs. These scheduled payments will be outlined in the agreement.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Use an Escrow Service?</h2>
<p>Most online escrow services also include a workflow that allows for the easy uploading of any documentation required by the parties involved in the sale, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspection forms from mechanics.</li>
<li>Bills of lading.</li>
<li>Photos of the vehicle to verify condition or progress of repairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these items can be easily uploaded to bolster the seller’s claim as to the vehicle’s condition and to ease the mind of any nervous buyer. This type of record is even more important if the sale is taking place between residents of different states or countries.<br />
The best part about using an online escrow service for your vehicle purchase is having all of these services done by the one company and all in one place. Online escrow platforms allow for documentation, transportation arrangements, and purchase funds to be held securely in one easy-to-access location with a full communication history available to either party at any time.<br />
When dealing with a buyer or seller unknown to you, using an escrow service gives you the best protection.</p>

With more and more fine art transactions taking place over the web and across the globe, buyers and sellers are both at greater risk of becoming victims of fraud. In addition to using a third party inspection service, like those services offered by our friends at <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a>, how can collectors protect themselves against potential fine art fraud? One of the most popular tools used to inspect all types of fine art is an ultraviolet light.<br />
<strong><em>How Does it Work?</em></strong><br />
Ultraviolet light reacts differently with various types of materials. When used at the 365 nanometer range, ultraviolet light will either be reflected or absorbed by some types of repair agents used to cover up flaws in fine art pieces. These very bright or very dark areas on items like paintings, ceramics, porcelain, and textiles can indicate areas that may have been repaired by the current owner or at some other point in the pieces lifetime.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Oil Paintings</em></strong><br />
Ideally, there should be a light blue haze that appears over the entire surface of the painting. This means that there&#8217;s an original coat of varnish present, and that the piece itself has had little to no restorative work done. While masking varnish can be used to conceal repairs and give the appearance of original varnishing, the uniformity of that more recent varnishing should be a dead giveaway. Dark blue-violet coloring can also indicate the presence of repair putty.<br />
<strong><em>UV with Ceramics and Porcelain</em></strong><br />
Repaired cracks will show as bright white when examined under UV light. UV examination can be especially helpful with color glasses cracks and repairs are more easily hidden by dark colors than with clear glass.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Textiles</em></strong><br />
Like ceramics and porcelain, textile repairs are easily spotted when inspected under UV light. Original threading in antique pieces will nor fluoresce under inspection the same way that newer thread will. The dyes used in more modern threads will react with an almost white light when exposed to UV rays.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Stone, Carvings, or Clocks</em></strong><br />
Natural stones will also react differently under UV light based on its age. Stone like marble will fluoresce as a strong purple if it was recently carve, but show as a muddled white if it has been aged. Aged ivory while take on a yellowish tone under UV, but newer ivory will shine with an intense purple color. Repair of clocks can also be easily spotted as the faces of the clocks themselves will appear as a blinding white if they have been repaired using modern materials.<br />
<strong><em>Protect &amp; Inspect</em></strong><br />
The best way to protect yourself from fraud is to put protections in place prior to buying or selling. <a title="Fine Art Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> services are the safest way to transmit funds between parties. Buyers are protected as funds are held safely with a neutral third party until there&#8217;s proof that the items has shipped, or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held up front &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds and credit card chargebacks. Buyers should also make it clear to their counter parts that they plan to have an item inspected prior to locking in payment plans. This isn&#8217;t intended as an insult to the seller, but due diligence that shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.<br />

From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

While there has been much discussion over the last 12 months or so regarding what Alibaba&#8217;s IPO would mean for ecommerce companies in the U.S., a number of other outlets have also taken a look at one of Alibaba&#8217;s subsidiaries &#8211; Alipay &#8211; that has integrated escrow into the backbone of its payment services. But before we get into what that integration of <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> could mean for other ecommerce payment methods, let&#8217;s take a look at the four main companies that comprise the Alibaba group.<br />
<strong>AliPay</strong> &#8211; AliPay is the number one method of payment for online goods in China. Essentially a copycat of PayPal, Alipay&#8217;s major differentiation is that it offers an escrow service &#8211; unlike PayPay &#8211; as a means to boost confidence in its platform for buyers and seller looking to enter into a new market.<br />
<strong>Alibaba.com</strong> &#8211; This is the Alibaba group&#8217;s B2B powerhouse. The site connects manufacturers direct to purchases for any myriad of products, and is the largest business-to-business platform in the world with over 7 million retailers.<br />
<strong>TMall</strong> &#8211; Essentially a way for retailers to sell direct to consumers, TMall has been the site used to introduce major like Nike and Apple to the Chinese market. The most similar business operated here in the U.S. would be Amazon with its brand-specific storefronts.<br />
<strong>Taobao</strong> &#8211; An online auction site similar to eBay, Taobao is the C2C arm of the Alibaba group. With auctions that allow for reserve prices and regular bidding, this consumer-to-consumer juggernaut uses Alipay as its payment platform of choice.<br />
<strong><em>So What Does Alibaba&#8217;s IPO Mean?</em></strong><br />
Last year alone, Alibaba&#8217;s group of companies transacted nearly $300 billion in goods &#8211; more than the entire U.S. ecommerce segment processed for 2013. Aside from the fact that Alibaba group&#8217;s IPO was also the largest in NYSE history, the company&#8217;s entrance into a U.S. exchange could signify an interest in expanding their business footprint beyond China&#8217;s borders.<br />
Should AliPay also begin to establish itself in western markets it could also mean the buoying of escrow to a more prominent place among other payment methods &#8211; a process now sometimes seen as an afterthought despite the fact that escrow offers exceptional financial protections for online transactions as compared to current payment methods. To truly compete on an even playing field, it would be great to see another online payment processor, like PayPal, integrate escrow to the same level that AliPay has. As they say, a rising tide raises all ships, and lifting U.S.-based escrow companies to a more prominent level would help both payment processors and consumers alike.<br />
The easiest way for ecommerce companies to protect themselves against a potential onslaught of competition from Alibaba&#8217;s four major sites would be to mimic the offerings of those sites just as Alibaba has mimicked other successful .coms. Look no further than 11 Main, the first site the Alibaba group has launched geared for a western market, for an example of how their teams are beginning to shape storefronts. To take a page from Alibaba&#8217;s playbook, U.S. ecommerce retailers could simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on a way to connect manufacturers and purchasers</li>
<li>Offer secure and reliable payment methods</li>
<li>Consider adding escrow as an accepted and/or preferred method of payment</li>
<li>Make international transactions easier to complete</li>
<li>Keep a strong consumer focus</li>
</ul>
<p>With the five tactics mentioned above, any advantage offered through one or all of the Alibaba-owned sites is negated. While the Alibaba group is no tame kitten, the elements of business in which they excel are all easily attainable for other web-based businesses with talented dev teams, or access to agile and capable partnerships.</p>

Websites like MachineTools.com have become a go-to resource for business owners who are looking to buy and sell machinery to a wider audience beyond their local auction houses. These online machinery auction sites bring together savvy buyers and sellers who need equipment or capital to continue growing their businesses, and are now nearly industry standard places to price out and complete machinery and equipment transactions.<br />
<strong><em>Know the Website</em></strong><br />
While reputable sites like <a href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> and <a href="http://machinesbook.com" target="_blank">MachinesBook.com</a> have gone to painstaking lengths to provide excellent service and security to their users, there are always scam or fraud sites that will spring up in the wake of a successful business model. Be sure to do some background research on the website you&#8217;re looking to buy or sell through. Often times, it can be as simple as calling the website&#8217;s customer service 800-number, or sending an email to their support team. If you get prompt, well-written responses you&#8217;re one step ahead of the game. Many fraudulent sites won&#8217;t even list a customer assistance phone line or will simply funnel emails to a noreply email address that&#8217;s never checked.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve closed your auction. Now that you&#8217;ve locked in a buyer or won your bid, it&#8217;s imperative to keep open lines of communication between yourself and the other party. If we see transactions struggle or fall apart, most times it&#8217;s due to a simple breakdown in communication &#8211; problems or questions that could easily have been solved through a quick phone call or email. Being prompt and responsive to any buyer or seller as to your expectations can alleviate most problems from the start.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
To help put buyers and sellers at ease, consider the use of <a title="PaySAFE Commercial Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a>. Even used machinery and equipment carry will carry heavier price tags, so online escrow companies like PaySAFE can add that extra layer of protection that both buyers and sellers are looking for. Buyers are protected as their funds are not released until there is proof of shipping, or the item has arrived at its final location. Sellers are protected as purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks &#8211; and are wired directly into their back account of choice upon release.<br />
Ultimately, buying and selling online comes down to a little extra legwork. If you&#8217;re willing to put in a little bit more time to research the auction site itself and work with buyers and sellers from across the country (or the globe), there can be great benefit for both parties.

Not only do you have to find either a willing party to sell their possession, or one who is interested in buying, you then have to juggle all of the negotiations and final agreements between the two. To make things easier, an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company like PaySAFE can help by receiving and disbursing funds among all parties &#8211; including your broker fees &#8211; and tracking documentation and approvals through time stamped histories.<br />
With a service like PaySAFE, your brokerage can also:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outsource fiduciary responsibility</strong> and avoid co-mingling of client funds and day-to-day operating cash</li>
<li><strong>Put the buyer and seller at ease</strong> in knowing that funds are held with a bonded and insured neutral party that is one-step removed from the broker</li>
<li><strong>Align motivations</strong> &#8211; sellers know that brokers only get paid at the same time they are</li>
<li><strong>Reduce operational costs</strong> &#8211; outsource your back office to a bonded and insured company like PaySAFE that specializes in collecting, reporting, and releasing funds. No longer will you need to monitor and manage multiple bank accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Provide 24/7 access</strong> &#8211; PaySAFE&#8217;s services are available at all times. While fund transfers are still beholden to traditional banking hours, requests and approvals from either party can take place at anytime, day or night. PaySAFE&#8217;s documentation history is also available at any time, allowing both parties to see time-stamped records of when actions took place within the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, online escrow through a company like PaySAFE provides greater security for both you and your clients. You can rest easy knowing that the transfer and reporting of funds is monitored and executed by a team of financial professionals, and your clients receive an extra layer of protection and documentation when buying and selling boats, cars, ATVs, firearms and other high dollar items.<br />
