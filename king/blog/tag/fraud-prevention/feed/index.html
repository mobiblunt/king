								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png"><img id="i-1206" class=" wp-image alignright" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png?w=487" alt="Image" width="204" height="204" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever purchased a home &#8211; or even looked into the process behind purchasing a home &#8211; you&#8217;ve probably seen the term &#8216;escrow&#8217; quite a bit. In the most basic layman&#8217;s terms, an escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third party; usually associated with high-value purchases.</p>
<p>But <a title="Escrow account on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow_account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow accounts</a> aren&#8217;t unique to real estate. These types of accounts can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction.</p>
<p>For example, say you were looking to purchase a classic car or a boat for your family vacations. Once you&#8217;ve located the pre-owned vehicle you want, you now are stuck dealing with a relative stranger for a purchase north of $10,000. How do you hold the seller accountable and ensure that you don&#8217;t fall victim to an online scam?Â Often <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online escrow</a> accounts help to fill that gray area between a buyer and seller who are unknown to each other.</p>
<h5>How Escrow Works</h5>
<p>As a neutral third party, the escrow company works to keep honest people honest and ensure that both parties can complete the transaction with much greater confidence than a money order or personal check. The buyer can transfer in the funds for the purchase knowing that it will be held in trust until they give the green light. The seller knows that the funds are available as soon as they provide the vehicle or goods to the buyer. The escrow company also has the ability to release partial funds to help with things like transportation or repair costs prior to the buyer receiving their purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, escrow accounts have greater use than real estate transactions. Anytime there are buyers and sellers looking for an extra layer of security in their deals, online escrow accounts are a great place to start.<br />
Have you ever used an online escrow company outside of real estate purchases? What did you find beneficial or difficult?</p>

The last two months of each year we all take a step back and enjoy the time we have with friends and family. It&#8217;s also a time of year that involves the largest uptick in shopping for many families as we purchase tasty treats and gifts for Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas and numerous other occasions. Unfortunately, this time of year also sees a spike in the number of scams &#8211; both online and off &#8211; that can ruin anyone&#8217;s holiday. So, to keep your yuletide merry, follow some of the simple fraud prevention tips below.<br />
<a href="http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/11/24/how-to-avoid-holiday-travel-scams/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Flight/Travel Scams:</em></strong></a><br />
With family and friends strung across the country, most Americans will do at least a little bit of traveling this holiday season. Scammers know this as well, and will often send offer of &#8216;free airfare&#8217; via email, fax or snail mail. These letters will often bare logos with striking resemblances to legitimate airlines or travel sites, but are actually phishing schemes designed to steal your personal information and/or credit card numbers. Always be sure to call and validate a deal that seems too good to be true, and NEVER give out your personal or banking information via email.<br />
<em><strong>Online Shopping Scams:</strong></em><br />
Cyber Monday is arguably the largest day of online shopping in the world. As we take the the web for great deals, scammers take to the web as well. Be sure to shop only on websites that offer Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protection or that bare the verification of third-party organizations like the Better Business Bureau or TRUSTe. Using your credit card also provides a layer of protection as you can easily contest any suspicious charges.<br />
<em><strong>Charity Scams:</strong></em><br />
Sadly, in a season of giving there are those who would take advantage of our good nature for their own purposes. There are many &#8216;sound alike&#8217; charities that pop up around the holidays. Use of the words &#8216;salvation&#8217; or &#8216;cancer&#8217; don&#8217;t always mean that a charity is legitimate. Giving online can also have pitfalls. Simply because a website ends with a .org doesn&#8217;t mean that the organization is an actual 501c(3) charity. When in doubt, call your charity of choice directly or visit them in person to make your holiday donations.<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=door-to-door+holiday+scams" target="_blank"><em><strong>Door-to-Door Scams:</strong></em></a><br />
Despite the cold weather in most of the country, this time of year sees an increase in door-to-door scams as well. These scammers will often pose as the on the ground representatives of charitable organizations or even tradespeople. Don&#8217;t fall victim to high-pressure sales techniques or sob stories that they may present. Again, when in doubt, tell them you&#8217;ll call the company yourself or give in-person at the organization&#8217;s local office. Some states also require a peddler&#8217;s license when selling door-to-door. Be sure to know the rules in your state and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for identification or proof that individuals are actually working with the company or organization they claim to represent.<br />
While <a title="Holiday Season Scams on Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/10/credit-cards-gifts-charity-internet-personal-finance-holiday-scams_slide_11.html" target="_blank">holiday season scams</a> don&#8217;t tend to vary greatly in substance when compared to the rest of the calendar year, these types of risks do tend to increase during the holidays. However, keeping tabs on your local news and following the tips above can help to keep your holidays season free of bad tidings.</p>

Congrats! Now comes the task of making sure it arrives safely from the seller, who just happens to live across the country. When you&#8217;re looking to ship any type of vehicle over a long distance there are a few items that you need to keep in mind to ensure your dream purchase doesn&#8217;t turn into a nightmare:<br />
<em><strong>1. Prepare</strong></em><br />
Any shipping company will want some basic information before they can give an estimate or schedule for pick-up. Items like the exact weight and dimensions of your vehicle can greatly effect the requirements for the shipper. Oversized vehicles like SUVs or custom designs can also incur extra fees, so be sure to ask additional questions if your dream car goes beyond traditional dimensions. Also be sure to thoroughly read through any paperwork &#8211; especially the <a title="Bill of Lading on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading" target="_blank">bill of lading</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s presented once the shipper arrives.<br />
<em><strong>2. Know Your Shipping Options</strong></em><br />
There&#8217;s definitely more than one way to ship a car. Some of the most common types of shipping vessels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enclosed or open containers</li>
<li>Multi-car trailer trucks or a pick-up, often called a hotshot</li>
<li>Non-stacking trailers</li>
<li>Multi-level carriers (you see these commonly at dealerships)</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of shipping options you choose will likely vary depending on the type of vehicle you&#8217;re shipping. You may also want to look around for shippers who specialize in a specific type of vehicle as well, such as classic cars or off-road vehicles.<br />
<em><strong>3. Know Your Shipper</strong></em><br />
Do some ground work and background research on any person or company that offers to ship your vehicle. It never hurts to ask about items like insurance, certifications and/or if the person your speaking with is a broker or the actual shipper. Much like researching a contractor or plumber, car shippers can vary from business to business.<br />
Above all else, never feel silly for asking questions. If you&#8217;re uncertain about any items that the shipper addressed, or not addressed, be sure to ask. And, as always, remember that if something seems too good to be true, it likely is.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a>Â and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

While November and December are obvious months when online shoppers should keep their guard up, in recent years there has been a significant uptick in financial and identity theft attempts around Valentine&#8217;s Day as well. Following the simple tips below can help to ensure that your Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping around the web doesn&#8217;t end in financial heartbreak.<br />
<strong><em>Be Wary of Dating Sites</em></strong><br />
Those looking for love are often feeling a little extra lonely this time of year. Scammers know this as well, and will often take advantage of those that are maybe a little too desperate to find that perfect someone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with someone through an online dating website, take the same pause that you would when shopping for a high dollar item like a classic car or luxury watch. As you communicate with the other person, a definite red flag should be an avoidance of conversation anywhere other than via email. While it&#8217;s prudent to be cautious when communicating with strangers on the web, it&#8217;s also odd to not eventually move that conversation to the phone, or even in-person.<br />
<strong><em>Phishing Scams</em></strong><br />
Similar to the routines run by criminals during the holiday season, many scammers will send out emails dressed in the guise of an online retailer or shipping company. If you receive an email that just doesn&#8217;t look quite right, or comes from an email address you don&#8217;t recognize, NEVER click on any embedded links. Many browsers will allow you to preview any hyperlinked text by simply scrolling over the text. Before you click, look toward the bottom left-hand site of your browser window to see where that link will send you.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Fall Too Fast</em></strong><br />
Love at first site is always possible, but be cautious if anyone on a dating website professes love right out of the gate. We all hope that that perfect someone is out there, but if something seems too good to be true it probably is. These claims of love are often followed by a deep desire to visit the other party in person, but they&#8217;re unable to due to financial hardship. Scammers will then ask their targets to wire money directly, or send a personal check so that they can then make the trip to visit. Of course, that trip never happens, and the target is out whatever funds were sent.<br />
Nobody wants to assume that every chance at love could be someone simply trying to scam them out of money, but taking the time to pause and reflect on any &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; scenario this time of year is a smart move.<br />

With each site requiring a password, it can be very tempting to simply repeat the same password often, or keep all of your passwords simple, but simple and often repeated passwords can be easy prey for hackers and online fraudsters. To ensure that your online accounts and the personal or financial information associated with each is kept safe, we&#8217;ve lined up six tips below to help keep your passwords strong.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Repeat Passwords</em></strong><br />
It may seem somewhat simple, but you should never repeat the exact same password for multiple logins. While you may want to use the same root word or number, it&#8217;s imperative that you add some unique characters to each account. Using this approach, hackers may be able to compromise a single account, but will have difficulty gaining access to other sites.<br />
<strong><em>Use Long, Sentence-Based Passwords</em></strong><br />
When most people think of passwords they think of a single word or combination of letters, but the only real limit to your passwords are character restrictions. Using an entire sentence of short phrase as your password can make your accounts extremely difficult to access for outside parties. Making the sentence extremely personal, like &#8220;I grew up in Omaha,&#8221; or &#8220;My college major was communications&#8221; can make your accounts inaccessible for anyone but you.<br />
<strong><em>Use Two-Step Verification</em></strong><br />
To add an extra layer of protection, websites like Facebook and Gmail have begun to offer two-step verification. This safety measure requires a second, non-web based verification before accounts can be access, or passwords changed. Most often, the service will send a text message with an access code to a mobile device. This way, if you aren&#8217;t the one requesting the password change, you would be notified that someone else is attempting to do so.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Easily Found Information</em></strong><br />
Many of us have a various pieces of personal information scattered around in public documents. Things like birth dates, maiden names, or names of children and relatives can be found somewhat easily by those who know where to look. Avoiding passwords based on that type of information is recommended.<br />
<strong><em>Change Passwords Regularly</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve ever worked in an office that deals with sensitive information, your IT team likely required a password change every three to six months. We recommend changing the passwords for your most sensitive personal accounts regularly as well. You can make it easy to remember by tying a password change to a regularly occurring event, like when you change your car&#8217;s air filter or after each dental visit.<br />
<strong><em>Use Pneumonic Devices</em></strong><br />
In elementary school we were all taught different tricks to help recall information that is difficult to remember off the cuff &#8211; like the order of the planets or multiplication tables. You can do the same thing when your passwords. For example, the phrase &#8220;This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8221; would translate to a password of TIWWCHNT. That nonsensical jumble of letters would be difficult for anyone to guess.<br />
While there may not be a 100% foolproof method to keep your passwords out of the hands of hackers, the six tips above can ensure that you&#8217;re on the right path to keeping your personal and financial information safe.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years phishing schemes, ransomware, and outright hacking have become extremely profitable for scammers. Because of the prevalence of online transactions both large and small, and the interconnectivity of both mobile and desktop devices, online thieves have been making a good living off of those who are unprepared. The infographic below, put together by <a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/infographics/how_hackers_earn_money" target="_blank">Kaspersky Labs</a>, shows just why there has been such a large jump in online attacks &#8211; they work.<br />

<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
One of the easiest ways to protect your finances in online transactions is to use an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. Buyers are protect as purchase funds are held with a neutral third party, and aren&#8217;t released until there&#8217;s proof that items have shipped or have even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds, and credit card chargebacks.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/smartphones.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2073" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/smartphones.jpg?w=300" alt="smartphones" width="300" height="199" /></a>For the past few years, some of the most popular gifts of the holiday season have been electronics &#8211; specifically, smartphones. The best parts of owning newer smartphones are the access it provides to the web and productivity apps to make everyday tasks easier. But the convenience of having access to your personal and financial information comes with added risks, specifically as it relates to scammers and phishing schemes. You can greatly mitigate those risks by following the tips below to keep your personal information safe while still having all the access you&#8217;d like on your new mobile device.<br />
<strong><em>Lock It Up</em></strong><br />
It may seem all to simple, but it&#8217;s surprising how few people will take the time to setup a simple screen lock on their new phone or tablet. Setting a numeric password or trace pattern on your device&#8217;s lock screen makes it extra difficult for your device to be accessed in the event that it&#8217;s stolen or misplaced. Without a lock screen password any and everyone can access your phone and all the information it holds.<br />
<strong><em>Turn Off Bluetooth</em></strong><br />
One of the benefits of today&#8217;s mobile devices is connectivity to household items and vehicles through Bluetooth. However, that ease of connection means that your device is continually searching for something to connect to, and scammers know that as well. Turning off Bluetooth when you know you&#8217;re not going to be connecting to any other devices can keep you safe from thieves looking to pirate your information, and it saves your batter as well.<br />
<strong><em>Setup Safeguards</em></strong><br />
Many of today&#8217;s mobile devices come equipped with safeguards in the event your devices is stolen or hijacked. Taking the five to ten minutes to activate safety features like remote access and/or remote wiping capabilities on your device can serve as an important, last ditch effort in protecting any personal or financial information stored on a mobile device that&#8217;s no longer under your control.<br />
<strong><em>Monitor Any Apps</em></strong><br />
There&#8217;s an app for almost anything under the sun. Ride sharing, mobile banking, music streaming services, online shopping &#8211; all of these apps will often give you the option to store data like credit or debit card numbers, banking account numbers and addresses in an effort to make your use of the app easier. While storing those pieces of information can definitely make using the apps easier, it can also leave that data vulnerable to potential hackers. Keeping track of the permissions you give to various apps on your phone, and not allowing any that seem questionable, can help to keep your information safe.<br />
While it&#8217;s impossible to plan for every eventuality when it comes to using a mobile device you can definitely plan ahead to mitigate any foreseeable issues. Setting a lock screen password, turning off Bluetooth when it&#8217;s not in use, and taking time to monitor your apps and setup remote access or deletion are all great ways to keep your information safe, but the best safeguard is your own intuition. If something just doesn&#8217;t seem right or seems too good to be true, it most likely is.<br />

From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

Scammers know this as well, and this is the time of year that they hope your everyday shopper will drop their guard when it comes to fraud protection for a chance at that unbelievable holiday deal. So, as the holiday buying season approaches, we&#8217;ve compiled some of the most common scam scenarios that government and private information advocacy groups think you should watch out for.<br />
<strong><em>Free Gift Card Scam</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s not uncommon for people to comparison shop on their mobile devices. So, scammers will often mass text a bank of numbers with a &#8220;free gift card code&#8221; that potential victims would enter on a fraudulent website. Once on the fake website scammers will ask for additional information, promising a free gift card to a major retailer in exchange for private information. Of course, the gift cards don&#8217;t really exist, and the scammers now have a plethora of personal information that was unwittingly handed over by deal-crazed shoppers.<br />
<strong><em>Malicious eCards</em></strong><br />
Most of us are familiar with the &#8220;Elf Yourself&#8221; video craze that first hit the internet around 2010, but not every promise of an entertaining holiday video on Facebook or Twitter is legit. These phishing schemes will promise social media users a hilarious holiday themed video in exchange for sharing the video out to their social network. However, much like with the fake gift card scam, once the user chooses to share the video scammers simply phish personal information from the users social media account.<br />
<strong><em>Near Miss Websites</em></strong><br />
The number of queries sent to search engines on Cyber Monday is enormous. Scammers know this as well and will often construct elaborate fake websites with web addresses that use common misspellings of major brands &#8211; think BesstBuy.com instead of BestBuy.com. In search of great deals many users will mistake the fake site for a real one as the hackers behind such scams will simply mimic the content and design of the legitimate website to further confuse their victims. This type of scam is especially dangerous as many online shoppers pay only glancing attention to the address of the website on which they&#8217;re shopping.<br />
<strong><em>Take Your Time and Protect Yourself</em></strong><br />
The common scams listed above are easily preventable if you simply slow down and think. We all want to get the best pricing we can when it comes to popular items, but double checking web addresses, examining senders of emails, and recognizing when an offer is too good to be true can go a long way to keeping your financial and personal information secure during the hectic holiday season. <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is also an absolute must for those buying and selling through online classified and auctions sites.<br />
