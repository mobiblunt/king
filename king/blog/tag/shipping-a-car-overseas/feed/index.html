On a day-to-day basis, tens of thousands of tons of goods move through customs at ports up and down both the Pacific and Atlantic coastlines as well as the southern ports ringing the Gulf of Mexico. But if you&#8217;re looking to <a title="Shipping Heavy Machinery Internationally" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/03/20/shipping-heavy-machinery-internationally/" target="_blank">ship heavy machinery</a> or vehicles, there are a few select ports that move far more <a title="Roll-on/Roll-off Cargo on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off" target="_blank">roll-on/roll-off (RORO)</a> cargo than others.<br />
If you happen to be on or near the East Coast you have a few RORO hubs at your disposal. Further north, Baltimore ships the lion&#8217;s share of vehicles and machinery with New York City coming in a distant second. Further south, the Florida ports of Jacksonville and Miami carry most of the RORO shipping loads &#8211; Jacksonville seeming to be the Baltimore of the South when it comes to RORO shipments. Smack in the middle of the northern and southern ports sits Charleston, South Carolina which, while significantly smaller in volume, does seem to offer a fair number of RORO shipping opportunities should larger ports not be an option for one reason or another.<br />
If you happen to be nearer to the Gulf region of the United States, Houston and Galveston, Texas handle the bulk of RORO shipments.<br />
Shifting to the Pacific side of America, we&#8217;re once again presented with a few options for <a title="How To: Shipping a Vehicle Overseas" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/03/18/how-to-shipping-a-vehicle-overseas/" target="_blank">shipping vehicles</a> or machinery out of major ports. In the north, Tacoma, Washington is a large port that handles a great deal of shipping to Alaska as well as destinations to the west like Japan and China. Southern California also boasts to large RORO shipping centers in Port Hueneme and Los Angeles.<br />
While the vehicle or machinery&#8217;s final destination will play a large role in which port will likely be responsible for shipment, work with your logistics or transportation coordinating team to ensure that you have collected all the proper documentation and materials required. Most U.S. ports will have similar documentation requests, but the destination port requirements can vary from country to country. Also bear in mind that seasonality does play a roll in RORO shipping availability. New model year launches for vehicles can be particularly busy as large numbers of newly manufactured vehicles are being both imported and exported &#8211; particularly on the west coast.<br />

While there are definitely more boxes to check when it comes to shipping vehicles internationally, there are a few easy steps you can take to make the process go more smoothly.<br />
<strong><em>Research the Laws of Both Countries</em></strong><br />
If you have an interested party from another country, be sure to read up on the import and export laws of their home country and your own. Details like the vehicle&#8217;s engine size, age and emissions are often closely regulated by both the importing and exporting country&#8217;s customs departments. You and the other party will also need to discuss who will cover the various taxes, tariffs or duties that may be associated with importing or exporting a vehicle. In the Unites States, you can consult these documents when <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - Importing a Car" href="http://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-car" target="_blank">importing a vehicle</a> or <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - Exporting a Car" href="http://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/export-docs/motor-vehicle" target="_blank">exporting a vehicle</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Work with a Licensed Moving Company</em></strong><br />
Not all transportation companies are licensed for business involving international shipping. Properly licensed companies will be registered with the Federal Maritime Commission, are well-versed in laws and regulations regarding importing and exporting vehicles, and are bonded to protect their customer&#8217;s belongings during transport. These companies can also provide customs processing services that may or may not be included in the transportation fee. Be sure to iron out the details with your transporter to find out if you may need to seek out a secondary company for customs services and the costs involved. Follow this link to <a title="Federal Maritime Commission OTI List" href="http://www2.fmc.gov/oti/" target="_blank">find out if your transportation company is licensed</a> by the FMC.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve done your homework and selected a transportation company, it&#8217;s time to protect and lock in your funds. <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Vehicle Escrow Services" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow services</a> a great method to secure purchase funds when dealing with an unknown second party. For buyers, purchase funds are held securely in escrow &#8211; helping to protect you against misrepresentation. For sellers, the buyer&#8217;s funds are verified up front and held in escrow before you ship the vehicle &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment.<br />
<strong><em>Prepare Your Vehicle</em></strong><br />
International shipping often requires the complete removal of things like gasoline or other flammable liquids before being loaded for transport. If you are planning to ship additional items with the vehicle &#8211; like vehicle parts or winter/summer tires &#8211; be sure to consult with your transport company. Many countries will not allow vehicles to enter port if they are filled with other items, so any additional components will likely need to be shipped separately from the vehicle itself.<br />
If you&#8217;ve completed all of the above steps but still have questions, never feel badly about asking for assistance. Your transportation and escrow companies often have a wealth of information and tips when it comes to their respective specialties, and the <a title="Federal Maritime Commission - Contact Us" href="http://www.fmc.gov/about/contact_us.aspx" target="_blank">Federal Maritime Commission</a> also has a 1-800 number for questions related to importing and exporting various items.</p>
