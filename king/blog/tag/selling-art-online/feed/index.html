With more and more fine art transactions taking place over the web and across the globe, buyers and sellers are both at greater risk of becoming victims of fraud. In addition to using a third party inspection service, like those services offered by our friends at <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a>, how can collectors protect themselves against potential fine art fraud? One of the most popular tools used to inspect all types of fine art is an ultraviolet light.<br />
<strong><em>How Does it Work?</em></strong><br />
Ultraviolet light reacts differently with various types of materials. When used at the 365 nanometer range, ultraviolet light will either be reflected or absorbed by some types of repair agents used to cover up flaws in fine art pieces. These very bright or very dark areas on items like paintings, ceramics, porcelain, and textiles can indicate areas that may have been repaired by the current owner or at some other point in the pieces lifetime.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Oil Paintings</em></strong><br />
Ideally, there should be a light blue haze that appears over the entire surface of the painting. This means that there&#8217;s an original coat of varnish present, and that the piece itself has had little to no restorative work done. While masking varnish can be used to conceal repairs and give the appearance of original varnishing, the uniformity of that more recent varnishing should be a dead giveaway. Dark blue-violet coloring can also indicate the presence of repair putty.<br />
<strong><em>UV with Ceramics and Porcelain</em></strong><br />
Repaired cracks will show as bright white when examined under UV light. UV examination can be especially helpful with color glasses cracks and repairs are more easily hidden by dark colors than with clear glass.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Textiles</em></strong><br />
Like ceramics and porcelain, textile repairs are easily spotted when inspected under UV light. Original threading in antique pieces will nor fluoresce under inspection the same way that newer thread will. The dyes used in more modern threads will react with an almost white light when exposed to UV rays.<br />
<strong><em>UV and Stone, Carvings, or Clocks</em></strong><br />
Natural stones will also react differently under UV light based on its age. Stone like marble will fluoresce as a strong purple if it was recently carve, but show as a muddled white if it has been aged. Aged ivory while take on a yellowish tone under UV, but newer ivory will shine with an intense purple color. Repair of clocks can also be easily spotted as the faces of the clocks themselves will appear as a blinding white if they have been repaired using modern materials.<br />
<strong><em>Protect &amp; Inspect</em></strong><br />
The best way to protect yourself from fraud is to put protections in place prior to buying or selling. <a title="Fine Art Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> services are the safest way to transmit funds between parties. Buyers are protected as funds are held safely with a neutral third party until there&#8217;s proof that the items has shipped, or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held up front &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, fraudulent checks, insufficient funds and credit card chargebacks. Buyers should also make it clear to their counter parts that they plan to have an item inspected prior to locking in payment plans. This isn&#8217;t intended as an insult to the seller, but due diligence that shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.<br />

Below we&#8217;ve compiled a grouping of some of the most commonly bought and sold items through luxury classified listings and auction sites.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</em></strong><br />
Whether it&#8217;s a cherry classic car, a fishing boat, or an ATV for your summer cabin, vehicles of all shapes and sizes are some of the most common listings you&#8217;ll find online. Most groupings of vehicles will have niche sites dedicated to specific buyers and sellers, but you&#8217;ll also find hundreds of listings on more generic auction sites, like ebay, and classified listings like those found on Craigslist. Regardless of what mode of transportation you&#8217;re looking for you&#8217;ll easily find a listing to fit your tastes on the web.<br />
<strong><em>Watches &amp; Jewelry</em></strong><br />
The online secondary market for jewelry and watches is enormous. Because of the longer lifespan of both watches and jewelry it&#8217;s common for original owners to sell their items as they upgrade to newer pieces. Luxury jewelry and watch owners also tend to take very good care of their purchases, which means buyers can often find slightly used items in excellent condition at a significant cost savings. Websites like <a title="JamesEdition.com" href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition.com</a> and ebay frequently have items up for bids that look and function just as well as they did when they were brand new.<br />
<strong><em>Fine Art</em></strong><br />
Much like jewelry and watches, fine art is nearly timeless. While tastes will often vary significantly from one collector to another, the internet has made it east to connect with others around the world who share those unique and specific tastes. Websites like <a title="Artnet.com" href="http://artnet.com" target="_blank">Artnet.com</a> have compiled listings from dealers and individual artists and made them available to collectors worldwide.<br />
<strong><em>Antique &amp; Collectable Firearms</em></strong><br />
Websites like GunBroker.com have made locating rare and unique firearms as simple as a Google search. With a massive dealer and person-to-person online marketplace, firearms collectors now easily connect around the world to buy and sell handguns, rifles, and shotguns. The vast majority of those sales are more everyday hunting rifles and handguns for simple target practice, there are also frequent auctions and listings for pistols, rifles, and shotguns that cost tens of thousands of dollars.<br />
Regardless of your specific areas of interest, if your tastes run to the luxury end of the scale you&#8217;ll be able to find a website that focuses on your hobby. As your average Joe has become comfortable listing common items online, wealthy individuals have followed suit and are now posting their wears in growing numbers.<br />

In recent years, <a title="Commissioned Art is Back" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/01/04/commissioned-art-is-sexy/" target="_blank">commissioned art has made a comeback</a> in a major way due in large part to the internet. No longer are collectors and art enthusiasts limited by their access to only local artists, but collaboration across the country and even around the world happens frequently. But while communication and idea sharing has never beenÂ easier, there are still certain considerations any commissioner should take into account when taking on a commissioned art project.<br />
<strong><em>Is the Artist Willing?</em></strong><br />
It may seem a simple thing to question, but determining whether or not your desired artist takes on commissioned work is an important step. Each artist will have their own approach to commissioned pieces, if they undertake those types of projects at all.<br />
<strong><em>Can You Afford the Piece?</em></strong><br />
Again, planning a budget seems like a no brainer, but the more well known an artist is the more likely it is that even small projects will command a large price tag. If the piece you want to commission is in a certain style or medium you may be better off working with a lesser known artist who creates work in a similar style. Which brings us to our next consideration&#8230;<br />
<strong><em>Does the Artist&#8217;s Style Fit Your Commission Idea?</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s rare to find an artist that spreads their talent across multiple styles or mediums, so while you may have a favorite artist it&#8217;s important to consider whether their style or expertise is a good fit for your idea. For example, it may not be the best idea to take a commission for a large watercolor mural to an artists who specializes in stone sculpture, or an impressionist reproduction concept to an artists who only creates ink and pencil sketches.<br />
<strong><em>Be Courteous</em></strong><br />
When first reaching out to artists realize that you may not be their number one priority. You may be a long time fan of their work, or even have communicated previously, but when commissioning work you now fall into a different category. If your project is time sensitive, be sure to allow adequate lead time to accommodate ideation, discussion of budget, work-in-progress updates and shipping/final delivery. Most importantly, realize that the artist is now taking time to build you into their schedule and likely has other personal or commissioned works in various stages of completion.<br />
<strong><em>Payment</em></strong><br />
Artists may have various requirements when it comes payment. For a simple and easy way to accommodate deposits, progress payments and clearing final balances, consider an online escrow company. Because the total commission price is deposited upfront, the artist can rest easy knowing that they won&#8217;t have difficulty in collecting payment. Buyers can also rest easy knowing that they don&#8217;t have to write a check for the entire project from the start. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE can also easily accommodate multiple payments. This can be very beneficial for commissioned projects that have long timelines and may require payments throughout the process.<br />
While commissioned projects often have deeply personal ties, planning and knowing your own budgetary limitations can help alleviate many common bumps in the road.
