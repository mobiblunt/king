While the condition of a vehicle may be more readily apparent, there are many nuances that a seasoned buyer will know to look for. The same can be said for firearms. Organizations like the <a href="http://www.nramuseum.org/gun-info-research/what%27s-my-gun-worth.aspx" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a> have tried to make the process a little easier for both buyers and sellers by establishing widely accepted rating scales for both modern and collector firearms. Familiarizing yourself with the scales listed below can be a big time saver, and give both buyers and sellers a realistic idea of what a firearm is worth.<br />
<strong><em>Modern Gun Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New/Perfect</strong>: This condition level looks like it&#8217;s never left the factory packaging.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: The firearm may have been used a few times, but there is zero sign of wear and tear. Wood, metal and bluing are in perfect condition except at the muzzle or any sharp edges.</li>
<li><strong>Very good</strong>: Perfect working condition, but with no noticeable wear on working components. No corrosion or pitting present.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Safe working condition. Minor wear is likely present on working components, but still no corrosion or pitting.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Safe working condition, but well worn. Replacement of some components may be needed. No rust should be present, but some minor corrosion is not uncommon at this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Antique/Collector Condition Standards</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory New</strong>: 100% original parts and finish. Perfect working condition inside and out.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent</strong>: This level still has all the original parts and 80%+ of the original finish. Any stamping, lettering or design on wood or metal is still crisp and clear. The wood should also unmarred and the bore in great condition.</li>
<li><strong>Fine</strong>: All original parts, but with 30%+ or so of the original finishing. Letter and stamping should also still be in near perfect condition, but dings or slight scratches on wood surfaces are present.</li>
<li><strong>Very Good</strong>: All original parts are present, but less than 30% of the original finish remains. All metal surfaces are original and still have crisp, sharp edges. Stenciling or lettering is clear, but wood surfaces have more noticeable scratches or dings. Bore condition is also less important at this level.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong>: Repair or replacement of minor parts. Rust may be present, but is smooth with minimal to no pitting and possible re-bluing of the finish. Letters and numbers are legible, and scratches or dents in wood surfaces may have been refinished or repaired.</li>
<li><strong>Fair</strong>: Major components may have been replaced at this level of conditioning, and minor parts may still need repairing or replacement. Light pitting is present over most of the firearm, and rust is more noticeable. Finishing has likely been cleaned vigorously or noticeably re-blued. Sharp edges have been worn down or rounded, and lettering or stencils may be partially worn away. The key is to be in decent working order, or can be made into that condition with a little effort.</li>
<li>Poor: Significant work would need to be done to bring this type of collector firearm back into working condition. Replacement and repair of both major and minor parts, significant pitting and rust, scratched surfaces, completely worn away printing and stenciling, and complete inoperability are calling cards of this condition level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other commonly used ratings systems include the <em>Blue Book of Gun Values</em>, based on the original finish system of rating, and <em>The Standard Catalog of Firearms</em>, which uses a system similar to the NRA rating terms, but with significantly different qualifications as to which items fall into which category.<br />

While these sites do an excellent job of monitoring and vetting users, if you&#8217;re new to online auctions and classified listings the process can be a bit daunting. The tips below can be a great help for buyers new to the online firearms world, and make sure that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard when you&#8217;ve found a used rifle that meets your needs.<br />
<strong><em>Ask Questions</em></strong><br />
Many times new buyers can be bashful when it comes to asking questions for sellers. You should never feel bad about asking too many questions. Veteran sellers will have all kinds of information at their disposal for the items they&#8217;re selling, and more often than not are happy to provide whatever they can. You should also ask questions of any customer service reps that the auction or classified site my provide. If things aren&#8217;t clearly spelled out from either the seller or the website&#8217;s FAQ, ask away!<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s a 50/50 shot as to whether or not a given website will have a secure checkout process. Even if the site does provide a checkout service, you should strongly consider an <a title="Gun Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service for any larger purchase. Online escrow works to protect you AND the seller. Buyers are protected as all funds are held with a neutral third party until there is proof that the rifle has shipped, or has even arrived at your chosen FFL holder for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as your purchase funds are verified and held upfront, completely removing the seller&#8217;s chances of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
<strong><em>Secure a Quality Inspection</em></strong><br />
Unless you happen to be an expert gunsmith you&#8217;ll want to line up an inspection. Companies like WeGoLook.com can schedule an inspector to visit the rifle in question and report back to you what they find. Depending on the specifications of the rifle, you may also want to build in time for you to inspect the rifle yourself once it arrives &#8211; especially if there are any custom components that the previous owner has added themselves.<br />
Ultimately, as the buyer the onus is on you to ensure that what you&#8217;re buying is what you think it is. While any legitimate seller will do their best to work with you on price, shipping and inspections, it&#8217;s up to you as the buyer to educate yourself as thoroughly as possibly on the processes and rifle itself.<br />
