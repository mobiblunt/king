Looking for a car or truck on auction sites like ebay is now one of the most common methods used by used car buyers. So, before you discount online listings in your next vehicle hunt, consider the three reasons below as to why more and more car buyers are moving online.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow Protection</em></strong><br />
The advent of online escrow services has made buying large ticket items online a much more secure process. <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies can now easily protect buyers by securing purchase funds in an escrow account until there&#8217;s proof that the vehicle has been shipped, or has arrived at its final destination. Buyers who use online escrow services can rest easy knowing that their funds will not be transmitted until they give the green light to do so &#8211; completely removing the need to share financial information with the second party, or send cashier checks hundreds of miles away with only the hope that the car will be shipped.<br />
<strong><em>Cast a Wide Net</em></strong><br />
The sheer number of vehicles listed on online classified sites and auction platforms is mind boggling. Even the largest used car lot in your area often has only a fraction of the vehicles listed on ebay at any given time. More choices means buyers have more options, and aren&#8217;t limited by simply what&#8217;s available at local dealerships.<br />
<strong><em>See The Total Purchase Price</em></strong><br />
With the exception of any potential shipping arrangements, the cost listed on online classified and auction sites is exactly the cost buyers can expect to pay. No hidden fees, unexpected taxes or financing fees &#8211; just the sticker price and nothing more. While buyers can always take extra steps like hiring a third party inspection company like WeGoLook.com, or specialized shipping through companies like uShip.com, online listed prices rarely include any surprise charges.<br />

From classic and antique automobiles worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to a first-time driver&#8217;s well used Honda, the web has opened up person to person trade for vehicles at an amazing pace. While there are literally tens of thousands of car classifieds across the web, not all websites are created equal. Below we&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the most secure and well-vetted websites for <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">buying and selling cars online</a>.<br />
<a title="Classified Car Listings with NationalVehicle" href="http://nationalvehicle.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>NationalVehicle.com</em></strong></a><br />
With listings for vehicles built as far back as 1908, NationalVehicle.com is sure to have a vehicle that fits your tastes. Specializing in must-sell listings, NationalVehicle has compiled an impressive group of classified car listings. Easy-to-use search functions make it easy to narrow down your search to a more manageable size, and their helpful customer service team is at the ready to assist with buyer and seller questions alike.<br />
<a title="Classified Car Listings with AutaBuy.com" href="http://autabuy.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Autabuy.com</em></strong></a><br />
With a hard copy catalog as robust as its online presence, Autabuy.com has gathered together over 200,000 listings for cars, trucks, motorcycles, RVs, boats and nearly anything else with an engine. With a simple search results page that allows you to sort by make/model, year, price and location, Autabuy.com makes it quick and easy to find exactly what you want. The site also has a robust parts section, and an easy-to-find contact section makes finding help a breeze.<br />
<a title="Classified Auto Listings with ebay Motors" href="http://www.ebay.com/motors" target="_blank"><strong><em>ebay Motors</em></strong></a><br />
If you&#8217;re not familiar with at least one of ebay&#8217;s vertical sites, you should be sure to dig into ebay Motors. Searching ebay&#8217;s classified auto listings is incredibly easy, and the bidding process for buyers is relatively straightforward. Sellers have numerous options when it comes to creating listings &#8211; including reserve amount, additional photo options, promoted listings and more &#8211; to help boost your listing to the exposure level you need. If you&#8217;re new to selling on sites like ebay Motors, check out our tips for selling items on sites like ebay.<br />
Regardless of the website you choose to buy or sell through, be sure that you protect your finances when it comes to the transaction itself. Online escrow services, like PaySAFE, are great options when buying or selling between two unknown parties &#8211; or those separated by large distances. Buyers can rest easy knowing that their funds are held securely with a third party until there&#8217;s proof that the vehicle has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers gain peace of mind in knowing that all funds are verified and held up front &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks or credit card chargebacks.<br />
