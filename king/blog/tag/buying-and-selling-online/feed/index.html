								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Taking these steps will help you.</h3>
<p>In a market rife with  fraud and product misrepresentation, buying a car sight unseen can be risky. Buyers want confidence that the vehicle is what the seller says it is and that they will not be the victims of fraud. Here are five steps that car buyers can take to minimize risk in .</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Inspection:</u></strong> You need to verify that the car is in the same condition as described in the ad.  You can have the seller take the car to a dealer close to them to do an inspection or there are independent inspection companies like <a href="http://wegolook.com">WeGoLook.com</a> which will dispatch an inspector to photograph or video the car.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping:</span></strong> Do not under estimate how much it will cost to transport the car to you or how complicated the process of finding a transporter is! There are companies like <a href="http://uship.com">uShip.com</a> that will help narrow your search options and give you a range of prices to choose from.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase agreement:</span></strong>  Set exact expectations up front with a purchase agreement.  This is often over looked for online purchases. You want to detail in writing, signed by both parties, what exactly is and isn&#8217;t included in the sale and the condition of the item. It is better to agree over whether the winter tires are included or are not now than 2 weeks later after the sale is done.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transfer purchase price:</strong> </span> This is the key point of terror for you, the buyer. The realization that you are going to wire tens of thousands of dollars cross country to a person you do not know for a car you have not touched and HOPE it shows up at your place in 10 days.  Luckily there is a company,<a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow"> PaySAFEescrow.com</a>, that handles this (and all 5 of these items) for you. Pay SAFE Escrow, Inc is an online escrow company that provides an easy to follow online workflow to properly document, track communication and transfer money safely.  PaySAFE holds the purchase amount in escrow until the transaction is complete than PaySAFE releases the funds directly to the seller.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Documentation:</strong></span> Just when you thought you were done, there is more paperwork.  You, the buyer, will need to register the car in your state and transfer ownership.  You will need the seller to sign a Bill of Sale and properly sign the back of the car title to transfer ownership into your name. Make sure the seller has all this documentation completed before the seller receives the funds.</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puzzle_niche.jpg?w=300" alt="puzzle_niche" width="300" height="225" /></a>Consumers can buy and sell pretty much anything online. Cars, firearms, jewelry, electronics, fine art &#8211; all of these items can be found with a simple Google search that will yield results on any number of auction and classified ad sites. Anymore, finding what you want to buy is the easy part &#8211; it&#8217;s protecting against potential fraud and misrepresentation that has become the new hurdle. There are two steps that should never be skipped in today&#8217;s online marketplace: inspections and financial protection with <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Inspections</em></strong><br />
As we&#8217;ve touched on before, the blessing and curse of online listings is that anyone, anywhere can create an ad. While the vast majority of the listings that you&#8217;ll find online are legit, there are always those who seek to take advantage of anyone they can. The easiest way to protect against misrepresentation in online listings is to schedule an inspection with a neutral third party.<br />
Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> have become the gold standard for individuals who aren&#8217;t able to inspect a potential purchase in person. WeGoLook will work with any potential buyer to schedule a time for one of their lookers to visit, inspect, and report back exactly what they found. These types of on-site visits can be anything from a quick once over with a few photographs, to a detailed, customized inspection that covers any must-see aspects of the item up for sale. Once you&#8217;ve seen the notes, photos and video from a thorough inspection conducted by a neutral third party, you can rest easy knowing that the listed ad does, indeed, match the real life item.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow</em></strong><br />
So, now that you&#8217;ve seen an inspection, how can you safely transmit or receive purchase funds? The protection services on many popular auction sites often have limits on the transaction amount that they will guarantee protection for, and these same services are heavily weighted in favor of the buyer. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE have created a safe, neutral payment processing platform that protects both buyers and sellers equally.<br />
With PaySAFE, both buyer and seller must both approve the same purchase agreement, which is easily reviewable at any point in time of the transaction. Purchase funds are then wired to, verified by, and held with PaySAFE until the buyer has proof that the item has been shipped, saving buyers the risk of sending payment and hoping their item arrives. Once proof of shipping has been provided the release of payment is approved, and purchase funds are wired directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice. This type of payment process protects sellers equally in that all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
For any consumer buying or selling high value items online, there really is no greater combination of protection than inspections and online escrow. By first confirming the authenticity of a listing with an inspection, and then transmitting funds with escrow, any online transaction can be secured from start to finish.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most popularly bought and sold items on the web are collectables &#8211; sports cards, coins, comic books, and many other lesser known pieces. Like any other highly specialized base of knowledge, there are those who spend years learning the intricacies of what separates top grade collectables from their inferior counterparts. While you may not have the time required to dedicate yourself fully to learning all the ins and outs of your specific hobby, the tips below can help to give you a better understanding of what certain items are viewed as higher quality than others.<br />
<strong><em>Baseball Cards</em></strong><br />
One of the more highly priced collectables sold on ebay has been a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card. While the card in and of itself is rare and valuable, there have been some that sold for a few thousand dollars, while others that sold for tens of thousands of dollars. What&#8217;s the difference? The difference lies in the condition of the card itself. A few simply marks or unintentional creases can make all the difference. For example, the card below on the left was rated as a grade 1 by <a title="Professional Sports Authenticators" href="http://www.psacard.com/Services/PSAGradingStandards" target="_blank">Professional Sports Authenticator</a>, while the other was rated as a grade 5. That four number difference in grading was also the difference between a card that sells for $6,000, and one that sells for over $25,000.<br />

<a href='https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/buying-collectables-online-know-your-grading/attachment/20150602141215/'><img width="150" height="150" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150602141215-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<a href='https://www.paysafeescrow.com/blog/buying-collectables-online-know-your-grading/attachment/20150602141310/'><img width="150" height="150" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150602141310-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>
<br />
<strong><em>Coins</em></strong><br />
Similar to the rating scale that PSA has established for sports cards, the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation has created its own rating system to evaluate coins. Based on a scale from 1 to 70, subtle dents of marks on the coin can make the difference between one that is valued at a few dollars, or a few thousand. You can also <a title="NGC Coin Grading Process" href="http://www.ngccoin.com/coin-grading/grading-process/index.aspx#video" target="_blank">watch a video on NGC&#8217;s website</a> to get a better idea of the entire process that goes into grading various types of coins.<br />
<strong><em>Toys and Action Figures</em></strong><br />
An increasingly larger community of collectors have circled back to their childhood and turned the buying and selling of older toys and action figures into big business. This increased interest from collectors has spawned the creation of the <a title="Action Figure Authority Ratings" href="http://www.toygrader.com/grading_information.aspx" target="_blank">Action Figure Authority</a>, a grading and rating authority that specializes just in action figures and other toys. This grading association has established four specific authorities that are further specialized in their areas of expertise &#8211; the Action Figure Authority, Collectable Doll Authority, Die-Cast Authority and Video Game Authority. Each of these authorities will rate any given piece on a scale of 1 to 10, with half and quarter grades being assigned for numbers 7.5 and above.<br />
Regardless of which avenue your favorite hobbies or interests may run, the key to knowing how to buy and sell online is knowledge. While you may not have the time to learn all of the intricacies of your specific interests, knowing the basics of how those items are rated and evaluated is the first step in ensuring that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard as you seek out that perfect find.</p>

Online buyers also have the advantage of shopping through millions of products from the comfort of their couch or office chair. While there is tremendous opportunity for both parties, how can you safely complete a transaction with someone who many not be just across town, but across the globe? Following the tips below can help to ensure that whether you&#8217;re buying or selling, you&#8217;ll always be safe.<br />
<strong><em>Keep Things Disposable</em></strong><br />
Many online auction and classified websites have their own email system where buyers and sellers can communicate within the platform. However, not all sites offer this type of functionality. If you don&#8217;t have the luxury of being able to communicate with the other party through the host sites system, consider creating a non-specific and easily deleted email account. This allows you to keep your regular emails from family and friends separated from any communications with unknown buyers and sellers. That insulation layer can also provide protection against scammers who may try to hack your email.<br />
<strong><em>Go Beyond Email</em></strong><br />
Communication through email is incredibly convenient, but it can also provide scammers a great place to hide. If you&#8217;re comfortable, attempt a phone conversation with the other party. Not only does this allow you to establish that there is a real person on the other end of the transaction, but it can be a great way to iron out details that may not translate well in an email message.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Consider using an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow is great for both buyers and sellers &#8211; especially when steep price tags are involved. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs. Buyers are also protected because funds are held securely with a neutral third party, and generally aren&#8217;t released until there is proof that the item has shipped or has even arrived for a final inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Get an Inspection</em></strong><br />
It not difficult to believe that any seller will always try to present their item in the best possible light. Some sellers will take things a bit too far and attempt to conceal damaged items. While you may be tempted to take the seller at their word you should always consider an inspection. Companies like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a> will setup a time for one of their lookers to visit the item you&#8217;re considering, and document the actual condition of the item. Depending on your requirements, these inspectors can even shoot video, or perform custom inspections to make sure that all of your concerns are addressed.<br />
When it call comes down to it, most people are better at recognizing a potential scam than they realize. If you ever get the feeling that something just isn&#8217;t right, or that it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. In that situation you should never feel badly about simply walking away from the deal.<br />

<strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
The safest way to have a vehicle, boat, or any other advertised item inspected &#8211; aside from inspecting the item yourself &#8211; is to take advantage of the services offered by third party inspection companies like <a title="Inspections by WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a>. The main advantage of a third party inspection company is that the inspector has no skin in the game whatsoever. Inspections provided by the seller can potentially be biased, just as inspections completed by the buyer&#8217;s preferred party can be skewed as well. By removing any potential bias, third party inspectors can give the most complete and trustworthy inspections for any item on the market.<br />
<strong><em>Trust the Professionals</em></strong><br />
Another reason to ensure that you get an inspection for any item comes down to knowledge. Unless you happen to be an expert mechanic, jeweler, or gunsmith, odd are good that you simply don&#8217;t have the depth of knowledge required to complete a thorough inspection. There are some people who devote their entire careers to researching the minutia of their chosen trade, and only those individuals will be able to give you a complete assessment of many unique or rare items listed on online classifieds and auction websites.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Buying Blind</em></strong><br />
Because the internet has opened up a vast marketing for all types of goods there&#8217;s always the chance that the item your researching isn&#8217;t anywhere near your home. While the seller may provide all kinds of photos and reassurances that the ad is 100% accurate, are you willing to drop several thousand dollars on their word alone? Having a third party inspector from companies like WeGoLook.com take a visit in your stead allows you to avoid buying blind and just hoping that what shows up at your doorstep is what&#8217;s it supposed to be.<br />
<strong><em>Reliable Funds Transfer</em></strong><br />
While having an inspection is always good for the buyer, that may not be the case for the seller. As a show of good faith, considering using an online escrow service to prove your good intentions as well. Online escrow holds and verifies funds upfront and simply holds those funds with a neutral third party until you give the go ahead to transfer the funds to the seller. Buyers are protected as funds aren&#8217;t moved until the inspector verifies the item, or it has already shipped. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
When it comes to inspections it&#8217;s always smart to go with the pros. Our friends at WeGoLook.com have the reliable and trustworthy inspectors that you can rely on to provide a thorough inspection of whatever you might be looking to buy.

From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/brokers.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1908" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/brokers.jpg" alt="brokers" width="276" height="276" /></a>There are very few things that your average Joe can&#8217;t accomplish on his own with a little research. The internet has placed infinite resources at our fingertips and opened up massive person-to-person marketplaces for buying and selling anything under the sun. Even still, there are some situations where using a broker can be advantageous for buying and selling online.<br />
<strong><em>Short on Time</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s true that you can find nearly anything you would like on online classified sites or auctions, but do you have the time to dedicate to your search? Hard-to-find items can take weeks track down and often require knowledge of niche markets. Unless you happen to have access to those types of marketplaces, a broker can be a great alternative. Brokers have taken years to develop the relationships and connections needed to find buyers and sellers for highly specialized or rare items.<br />
<strong><em>Save the Paperwork</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve found the car or artwork you&#8217;re looking for you now have to draft up the proper paperwork to complete the transaction and ensure that you have the correct documentation. Again, brokers can save you time and hassle as they put together these types of deals on a regular basis &#8211; gathering all the paperwork together for you and the other party into one single portfolio.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Brokers will often work with an <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other financial entity to ensure that the transfer of funds is safe and secure. Brokers that work with a platform like PaySAFE have the ability to compile the purchase agreement and any additional documentation or photos into a single interface for both the buyer and seller to view. PaySAFE then coordinates with the broker to ensure that all funds are verified and held before the seller ships the item, and that the buyer has proof of shipping or confirms delivery before their purchase funds are deposited directly into the seller&#8217;s bank account of choice.<br />
Ultimately, the decision as to whether or not you would like to use a broker comes down to personal preference. Some buyers and sellers enjoy coordinating all aspects of a transaction on their own and have the time to do so. But if you&#8217;re a busy individual in search of a highly specialized or rare item, looking into the services of a broker may be a great alternative.<br />

While there has been much discussion over the last 12 months or so regarding what Alibaba&#8217;s IPO would mean for ecommerce companies in the U.S., a number of other outlets have also taken a look at one of Alibaba&#8217;s subsidiaries &#8211; Alipay &#8211; that has integrated escrow into the backbone of its payment services. But before we get into what that integration of <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> could mean for other ecommerce payment methods, let&#8217;s take a look at the four main companies that comprise the Alibaba group.<br />
<strong>AliPay</strong> &#8211; AliPay is the number one method of payment for online goods in China. Essentially a copycat of PayPal, Alipay&#8217;s major differentiation is that it offers an escrow service &#8211; unlike PayPay &#8211; as a means to boost confidence in its platform for buyers and seller looking to enter into a new market.<br />
<strong>Alibaba.com</strong> &#8211; This is the Alibaba group&#8217;s B2B powerhouse. The site connects manufacturers direct to purchases for any myriad of products, and is the largest business-to-business platform in the world with over 7 million retailers.<br />
<strong>TMall</strong> &#8211; Essentially a way for retailers to sell direct to consumers, TMall has been the site used to introduce major like Nike and Apple to the Chinese market. The most similar business operated here in the U.S. would be Amazon with its brand-specific storefronts.<br />
<strong>Taobao</strong> &#8211; An online auction site similar to eBay, Taobao is the C2C arm of the Alibaba group. With auctions that allow for reserve prices and regular bidding, this consumer-to-consumer juggernaut uses Alipay as its payment platform of choice.<br />
<strong><em>So What Does Alibaba&#8217;s IPO Mean?</em></strong><br />
Last year alone, Alibaba&#8217;s group of companies transacted nearly $300 billion in goods &#8211; more than the entire U.S. ecommerce segment processed for 2013. Aside from the fact that Alibaba group&#8217;s IPO was also the largest in NYSE history, the company&#8217;s entrance into a U.S. exchange could signify an interest in expanding their business footprint beyond China&#8217;s borders.<br />
Should AliPay also begin to establish itself in western markets it could also mean the buoying of escrow to a more prominent place among other payment methods &#8211; a process now sometimes seen as an afterthought despite the fact that escrow offers exceptional financial protections for online transactions as compared to current payment methods. To truly compete on an even playing field, it would be great to see another online payment processor, like PayPal, integrate escrow to the same level that AliPay has. As they say, a rising tide raises all ships, and lifting U.S.-based escrow companies to a more prominent level would help both payment processors and consumers alike.<br />
The easiest way for ecommerce companies to protect themselves against a potential onslaught of competition from Alibaba&#8217;s four major sites would be to mimic the offerings of those sites just as Alibaba has mimicked other successful .coms. Look no further than 11 Main, the first site the Alibaba group has launched geared for a western market, for an example of how their teams are beginning to shape storefronts. To take a page from Alibaba&#8217;s playbook, U.S. ecommerce retailers could simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on a way to connect manufacturers and purchasers</li>
<li>Offer secure and reliable payment methods</li>
<li>Consider adding escrow as an accepted and/or preferred method of payment</li>
<li>Make international transactions easier to complete</li>
<li>Keep a strong consumer focus</li>
</ul>
<p>With the five tactics mentioned above, any advantage offered through one or all of the Alibaba-owned sites is negated. While the Alibaba group is no tame kitten, the elements of business in which they excel are all easily attainable for other web-based businesses with talented dev teams, or access to agile and capable partnerships.</p>

Websites like MachineTools.com have become a go-to resource for business owners who are looking to buy and sell machinery to a wider audience beyond their local auction houses. These online machinery auction sites bring together savvy buyers and sellers who need equipment or capital to continue growing their businesses, and are now nearly industry standard places to price out and complete machinery and equipment transactions.<br />
<strong><em>Know the Website</em></strong><br />
While reputable sites like <a href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> and <a href="http://machinesbook.com" target="_blank">MachinesBook.com</a> have gone to painstaking lengths to provide excellent service and security to their users, there are always scam or fraud sites that will spring up in the wake of a successful business model. Be sure to do some background research on the website you&#8217;re looking to buy or sell through. Often times, it can be as simple as calling the website&#8217;s customer service 800-number, or sending an email to their support team. If you get prompt, well-written responses you&#8217;re one step ahead of the game. Many fraudulent sites won&#8217;t even list a customer assistance phone line or will simply funnel emails to a noreply email address that&#8217;s never checked.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve closed your auction. Now that you&#8217;ve locked in a buyer or won your bid, it&#8217;s imperative to keep open lines of communication between yourself and the other party. If we see transactions struggle or fall apart, most times it&#8217;s due to a simple breakdown in communication &#8211; problems or questions that could easily have been solved through a quick phone call or email. Being prompt and responsive to any buyer or seller as to your expectations can alleviate most problems from the start.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
To help put buyers and sellers at ease, consider the use of <a title="PaySAFE Commercial Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a>. Even used machinery and equipment carry will carry heavier price tags, so online escrow companies like PaySAFE can add that extra layer of protection that both buyers and sellers are looking for. Buyers are protected as their funds are not released until there is proof of shipping, or the item has arrived at its final location. Sellers are protected as purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks &#8211; and are wired directly into their back account of choice upon release.<br />
Ultimately, buying and selling online comes down to a little extra legwork. If you&#8217;re willing to put in a little bit more time to research the auction site itself and work with buyers and sellers from across the country (or the globe), there can be great benefit for both parties.

New car smell. Clothes fresh out of the laundry. Never before lived-in homes. There&#8217;s a major rush that we get when something is fresh out of the package and hasn&#8217;t been touched since coming off the assembly line. And new things are great, but when it comes to big tickets items why would you pay new item prices when you could get equally good functionality at a lower cost from a slightly used item?<br />
<strong><em>Machinery &amp; Equipment</em></strong><br />
New machinery can be a huge expense for any business. Not only is the price tag higher, but businesses often need to go through the process of financing unless they happen to have large sums of cash on hand. So, why go through the hassle when used equipment can give you the functionality you need at a price point that won&#8217;t put you into the red? The secondary machinery market that businesses can access through sites like <a title="MachineTools.com" href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> or <a title="MachineBook.com" href="http://machinebook.com" target="_blank">MachineBook.com</a> is massive. Tens of millions of dollars change hands annually, and now that the global economy is starting an upswing, demand for quality used machinery and equipment is on the rise. This secondary market also gives businesses the chance to pad their own accounts by selling used machinery to free up capital for other types of expansion.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</em></strong><br />
We all need reliable transportation, but the cost of new vehicle ownership can sometimes be too much to handle. Sites like <a href="http://craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> and <a href="http://nationalvehicle.com" target="_blank">NationalVehicle.com</a> have listings for thousands of pre-owned cars, trucks, RVs and motorcycles that can get you the transportation you need at extremely affordable prices. If you tastes go to the extreme, <a href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition</a> has even compiled listings for pre-owned items like yachts, helicopters, Rolex watches and luxury cars.<br />
<strong><em>Buyer &#8211; and Seller &#8211; Beware</em></strong><br />
Ultimately, the items you can find on the sites listed above are great so long as you have a way to protect your finances during the transaction. Without the benefit of a financing company or dealership to package monthly payments, transactions for used items are usually a single lump sum payment. As these purchases often take place between two parties with little to no experience with one another &#8211; and are many time separated by a distance that requires involving a shipping company &#8211; <a title="PaySAFE Online Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> can be of great benefit to both the buyer and seller. Buyers are protected knowing that their purchase funds will be held securely with a neutral third party until there is proof that the item has been shipped, or has even arrived for their inspection at the final destination. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified in advance, eliminating the risk of fraudulent checks, insufficient funds or credit card charge backs.<br />
While these secondary markets can be amazing finds when it comes to saving time and money, it behooves any buyer or seller to learn the ropes before diving in head first. There are different requirements and practices for each marketplace, and taking the time to ask questions of customer service reps or seasoned users can be a huge help. More often than not there&#8217;s one old adage that can save even the most veteran online buyer or seller: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
