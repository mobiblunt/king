New car smell. Clothes fresh out of the laundry. Never before lived-in homes. There&#8217;s a major rush that we get when something is fresh out of the package and hasn&#8217;t been touched since coming off the assembly line. And new things are great, but when it comes to big tickets items why would you pay new item prices when you could get equally good functionality at a lower cost from a slightly used item?<br />
<strong><em>Machinery &amp; Equipment</em></strong><br />
New machinery can be a huge expense for any business. Not only is the price tag higher, but businesses often need to go through the process of financing unless they happen to have large sums of cash on hand. So, why go through the hassle when used equipment can give you the functionality you need at a price point that won&#8217;t put you into the red? The secondary machinery market that businesses can access through sites like <a title="MachineTools.com" href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> or <a title="MachineBook.com" href="http://machinebook.com" target="_blank">MachineBook.com</a> is massive. Tens of millions of dollars change hands annually, and now that the global economy is starting an upswing, demand for quality used machinery and equipment is on the rise. This secondary market also gives businesses the chance to pad their own accounts by selling used machinery to free up capital for other types of expansion.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</em></strong><br />
We all need reliable transportation, but the cost of new vehicle ownership can sometimes be too much to handle. Sites like <a href="http://craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> and <a href="http://nationalvehicle.com" target="_blank">NationalVehicle.com</a> have listings for thousands of pre-owned cars, trucks, RVs and motorcycles that can get you the transportation you need at extremely affordable prices. If you tastes go to the extreme, <a href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition</a> has even compiled listings for pre-owned items like yachts, helicopters, Rolex watches and luxury cars.<br />
<strong><em>Buyer &#8211; and Seller &#8211; Beware</em></strong><br />
Ultimately, the items you can find on the sites listed above are great so long as you have a way to protect your finances during the transaction. Without the benefit of a financing company or dealership to package monthly payments, transactions for used items are usually a single lump sum payment. As these purchases often take place between two parties with little to no experience with one another &#8211; and are many time separated by a distance that requires involving a shipping company &#8211; <a title="PaySAFE Online Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> can be of great benefit to both the buyer and seller. Buyers are protected knowing that their purchase funds will be held securely with a neutral third party until there is proof that the item has been shipped, or has even arrived for their inspection at the final destination. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified in advance, eliminating the risk of fraudulent checks, insufficient funds or credit card charge backs.<br />
While these secondary markets can be amazing finds when it comes to saving time and money, it behooves any buyer or seller to learn the ropes before diving in head first. There are different requirements and practices for each marketplace, and taking the time to ask questions of customer service reps or seasoned users can be a huge help. More often than not there&#8217;s one old adage that can save even the most veteran online buyer or seller: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />

According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, a number of factors, such as the increasing cost of Chinese labor and rising transportation costs, are <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/10minutes/assets/pwc-la-13-0048-us-reshoring-v9.pdf" target="_blank">helping to make on-shoring a more appealing option</a> for U.S.-based manufacturers. While all of these elements point toward a more sustained period of growth for the manufacturing industries, what does it mean for those looking to start new businesses or expand their current operations?<br />
One of the most appealing aspects of a resurgence in manufacturing is the ability for companies to access a more readily available secondary market for equipment. During the recession, businesses were frequently holding onto any excess capital in an attempt to cushion any further dips in the economy. Now that a skilled labor market is at the ready and demand is increasing, manufacturers are beginning to replace older machinery &#8211; freeing up used machinery for new or expanding businesses.<br />
At odds with what most are seeing in everyday headlines, some of the biggest gains in manufacturing from this secondary market have been from small businesses. As larger manufacturers turn to smaller companies to create the specialty parts they need to repair and expand their own operations, in turn, smaller businesses are seeing a boom and need for more equipment themselves. But just because demand is growing doesn&#8217;t mean negotiating has to go out the window.<br />
<strong><em>Know The Value</em></strong><br />
While there is a definite uptick in manufacturing it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s still room for negotiation. While sellers shouldn&#8217;t be willing to give away good, used machinery, it doesn&#8217;t mean that buyers can&#8217;t demand a fair market price &#8211; which has definitely shifted in a post-recession business climate.<br />
<strong><em>Do You Have Everything?</em></strong><br />
There are often dozens of options that can be added onto a more basic piece of machinery. Sellers should clearly disclose any attachments, accessories or software that may or may not be included. Buyers also need to be clear in what they expect to be included with their purchase. If there are components that definitely need to be included don&#8217;t hesitate to write those items into your purchase agreement.<br />

First and foremost, if you&#8217;re looking to add some new iron to your arsenal price is always a consideration. That being said, there are some other aspects you should definitely take into consideration when looking at used equipment at farm auctions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shop Around</em></strong><br />
According to Greg Peterson, Farm Journal Media&#8217;s used-equipment expert, <a title="Machinery Pete’s 5 Tips for Buying Used Equipment" href="http://www.agweb.com/article/machinery_petes_5_tips_for_buying_used_equipment_NAA_Sara_Schafer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farm auctions often have some of the highest prices on the market</a>. Because of that, it&#8217;s important to seek out and compare prices in other arenas &#8211; consignments, dealer and online auctions for example. As Peterson points out, saving 3-5% on machinery priced at $300,000 or more can be a significant savings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read the Fine Print</em></strong><br />
From a buyer&#8217;s perspective, be sure to pay close attention to the descriptions offered by the seller or auction house. If anything seems amiss don&#8217;t be afraid to call the seller or auction house and see if they&#8217;re able to fill in the blanks. Also be sure to find out what guarantees or warranties may be attached to the equipment or if it&#8217;s being sold in &#8216;as is&#8217; condition.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inspect the Goods</em></strong><br />
Inspections can be the key when it comes to buying any used equipment. As construction and agriculture equipment can really take a beating &#8211; especially if it isn&#8217;t well maintained &#8211; a thorough pre-inspection by a certified farm equipment mechanic can be the difference between a great buy and a lemon. While the vast majority of live farm equipment auctions will start-up and put the item into action before beginning bidding, it is not uncommon at all for items to be sold with no guarantees as to condition and operation. Ritchie Bros. has a great checklist of <a title="Inspection tips: what to inspect before buying a used farm tractor" href="https://www.rbauction.com/blog/inspection-tips-what-to-inspect-before-buying-a-used-farm-tractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what you should inspect with tractors</a> specifically.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn the Language</em></strong><br />
Auctions and auctioneers have a language all their own. Do you know the difference between an absolute auction and an American auction? How about absentee bids and proxy bids? Be sure to familiarize yourself with any unfamiliar terms and check out this <a title="Auction Terminology and Definitions" href="http://www.auctionguide.com/tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of auction terms and definitions</a> for a crash course in auction terminology.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maintain Your Equipment</em></strong><br />
This may seem like a no-brainer, but performing regular maintenance and keeping your machinery in good mechanical and aesthetic condition can greatly affect the resale value. While individual preferences will vary from buyer to buyer, well maintained and cared for machinery will always fetch a more pleasing price for the seller once it hits the auction block.</p>
<p><strong><em>Protect Your Investment</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re purchasing equipment outside of an auction setting, be sure you take steps to protect your investment &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re buying/selling with an unfamiliar second party or over long distances. In those instances, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Commercial &amp; Agriculture Equipment" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow services</a> can be a great protection for both the buyer and seller to guarantee both funds and delivery of the equipment.</p>
<p><a href="/equipment/how-paysafe-works-equipment/">With PaySAFE® Escrow&#8217;s simple step-by-step process</a>, buyers can rest assured that their purchase will arrive after having submitted payment. Sellers too can be confident that purchase funds are verified up front and held securely with a neutral third party – eliminating the risk of non-payment. Farm equipment transactions done online or via auction can be risky, and you want to have the confidence that the other party is legitimate. Buyers and sellers of farm equipment trust PaySAFE® Escrow to facilitate transactions in a process that makes the transfer of assets safe, secure and simple.</p>

After putting your nose to the grindstone your business is taking off &#8211; you&#8217;re in a position to expand your operation. Expansion is great, but with growth comes additional expense. So, before you place that order for brand new machinery, vehicles and equipment, be sure to explore the used machinery market. Not only does pre-owned machinery come at a reduced cost, it&#8217;s often in very good working order that allows you to continue your expansion without breaking the bank.<br />
As with any large business purchase, there are certain items you should watch out for when perusing the used machinery market.<br />
<strong><em>Do Your Homework</em></strong><br />
Do a little background checking on the company or individual selling the machinery you&#8217;re looking to buy. If you have colleagues in the same industry it never hurts to ask for referrals. It&#8217;s also smart to ask for any references the seller might be able to provide.<br />
<strong><em>Kick the Tires</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve found the machinery you&#8217;re looking for locally, go and check it out in person. If you&#8217;re not able to inspect the equipment in person, ask that the seller provide video or other proof of the item you want being put through its paces.<br />
<strong><em>Guarantees</em></strong><br />
Does the machinery for sale come with any guarantees or warranties? If buying from a dealer, did they they perform any type of inspection to verify condition? Never feel bad about asking for additional documentation if the seller makes claims regarding warranties or guarantees of any type.<br />
<strong><em>Are Batteries Included?</em></strong><br />
Used machinery can sometimes be used as an in-house salvage yard for other machinery, so be sure to verify that all components and pieces are present. If you&#8217;re buying direct from the previous owner, ask about how the equipment was used and how long it&#8217;s been idle. These can be good clues as to how the item was used once it was replaced.<br />
Regardless of your final decision when it comes to purchasing used machinery, it&#8217;s always smart to protect yourself as much as possible from misrepresentation. The easiest way to do so is through the use of an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow for Commercial Goods &amp; Machinery" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online escrow company</a> that will hold your funds safely until you&#8217;ve had a chance to verify the machinery is as advertised. Short of that, be sure to ask the seller about any return or money-back policies they may have in place. And, as always, if something seems to good to be true it probably is.</p>
