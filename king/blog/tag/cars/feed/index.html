								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When buying an automobile online or through a classified ad in a newspaper, fraud is a real threat, as many well-meaning buyers all-too-often fall victim to scammers. This being the case, it&#8217;s important to take the proper measures to protect yourself. The following tips will help you make sure you avoid fraudulent transactions. For starters, just being aware that you could be taken advantage of is a great first step to avoiding scam artists.<br />
Using PaySAFE to complete a transaction is also a great way to avoid fraud. Acting as a neutral third party escrow service, PaySAFE offers both buyer and seller safe, secure and easy-to-use tools to close the deal. No money is exchanged until all the terms of the transaction are approved by the buyer and the seller.<br />
<strong>Use common sense</strong><br />
Double checking everything and using common sense will go a long way in protecting yourself from scammers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know the market value.</strong> Unless you&#8217;re buying from a friend or family member, you should expect to pay the market value for the car you&#8217;re interesting in purchasing. That said, be very suspicious if a vehicle is priced much lower than market value &#8212; it&#8217;s most likely bait from a scammer to lure you in.</li>
<li><strong>Match the seller to owner.</strong> Obtaining a history report provides all kinds of useful information, like whether or not the seller&#8217;s name is on the title (it should be), if the car&#8217;s had any accidents reported to authorities and if the car&#8217;s ever been reported stolen, salvaged or damaged. <a href="http://www.carfax.com/entry.cfx">CARFAX</a> is an easy way to obtain a history report.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect the car.</strong> Take the car to a trusted mechanic of your choice for an inspection. If the car is out-of-state, hire a <a href="http://testdrivetech.net/paysafe/" target="_blank">professional inspection service</a>. NEVER let the seller take the car to a mechanic of their choice.</li>
<li><strong>Match VIN number on car to VIN number on title.</strong> If these two numbers match, you&#8217;re clear to (cautiously) proceed with the transaction. If they don&#8217;t match, get an explanation from the seller, as you might be dealing with a stolen car.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the car isn&#8217;t flood-damaged.</strong> If possible, the mechanic who conducts the inspection should also be trained in handling flood-damaged vehicles. (Warning signs include water lines and mud or mildew under carpets, on the trunk floor and in enclosed areas such as door panels and the gas tank.) Checking the title may reveal if the car&#8217;s been salvaged, however not all states require this. Last, check the VIN in the <a href="http://www.nicb.org/" target="_blank">National Insurance Crime Bureau</a> database of vehicles involved in recent hurricanes. This service is free-of-charge, but keep in mind it doesn&#8217;t cover all flood-damaged vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm the seller&#8217;s contact info.</strong> Verify the seller&#8217;s street address and phone number before sending any payment (for this, it&#8217;s preferred to use PaySAFE escrow service). Also, if the seller lives overseas, be very cautious &#8212; and always use PaySAFE&#8217;s escrow service.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of too much email communication.</strong> Using email is fine for the most part, just be sure to NEVER send any sensitive personal or financial information &#8212; like your social security number, credit card number or checking account number &#8212; by email. It&#8217;s also a red flag if the seller refuses to talk to you on phone.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a detailed receipt.</strong> The receipt should include if the car is being sold with a warranty or &#8220;as is.&#8221; Also, it should state any/all accessories that are included. Using PaySAFE allows you to describe in detail all warranties and expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Get the car&#8217;s title.</strong> Before you purchase the vehicle, make sure you know what&#8217;s required in your state to properly transfer the title. Your local DMV has plenty of info.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever sold your own used car before, you know the process is much more difficult than it initially sounds. Still, the major benefit of taking on the extra time and hassle goes without saying: you&#8217;ll receive more money by selling your car directly to a buyer, rather than trading it to a dealer for a fraction of its retail value.<br />
Using PaySAFE makes selling your used car directly to a buyer simple, secure and easy, providing peace of mind for both parties that the terms of the transaction will be completed.<br />
But before using PaySAFE, there are some steps you can take to make sure your car is attractive to potential buyers. To help, <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/car-buying-advice/guide-to-new-car-buying/trading-in/how-to-sell-your-used-car/index.htm" target="_blank">Consumer Reports offered a guide on how to sell a car</a>, highlighted below.<br />
<strong>Selling your car yourself means more money (and effort)</strong><br />
According to Consumer Reports, you can always expect to get more than the wholesale price, but most buyers will expect to pay a little less than the retail price, unless you&#8217;re selling a high demand vehicle, such as a classic car. Still, you&#8217;ll have to advertise your sale, interact with potential buyers and even show the car in person, perhaps even multiple times.<br />
<strong>Price is important</strong><br />
Have a good idea of the local asking price of your vehicle. This will help you set a reasonable price tag. It&#8217;s usually a good bet, as Consumer Reports notes, to mark the initial price a little higher than what you&#8217;re willing to take for it, leaving room for negotiation.<br />
<strong>Advertising</strong><br />
According to Consumer Reports, some of the most effective ways to advertise your car include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word of mouth (tell friends, family, colleagues, etc.)</li>
<li>Online classified ads on websites like Cars.com, MSN Auto, Kelley Blue Book &#8212; even Craigslist</li>
<li>An ad in the daily newspaper, weekly shopper and/or local free newspaper.</li>
<li>Go the traditional route and simply put a &#8220;For Sale&#8221; sign in your window with basic details, including contact info</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Showing the car</strong><br />
After advertising your sale, Consumer Reports suggests to keep your car&#8217;s stats, such as mileage and other particulars, nearby. When a potential buyer shows up to take a closer look, answer all questions honestly, be able to provide service receipts and prepare to take the buyer on a test drive to an independent mechanic.<br />
<strong>Pre-purchase inspection</strong><br />
Any savvy buyer will want to have your car inspected by a mechanic before purchase. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem amongst friends and family, but if the buyer is a stranger, as noted by Consumer Reports, you&#8217;ll probably want to drive the car to the shop yourself for the inspection.<br />
<strong>Know your paperwork</strong><br />
Since paperwork requirements vary state by state, contact the local DMV for instructions. Any outstanding loans on the vehicle require the lender gets its money before you, notes Consumer Reports. Also, be sure to include a proper bill-of-sale as well for both parties sales-tax purposes.<br />
