Below we&#8217;ve compiled a grouping of some of the most commonly bought and sold items through luxury classified listings and auction sites.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</em></strong><br />
Whether it&#8217;s a cherry classic car, a fishing boat, or an ATV for your summer cabin, vehicles of all shapes and sizes are some of the most common listings you&#8217;ll find online. Most groupings of vehicles will have niche sites dedicated to specific buyers and sellers, but you&#8217;ll also find hundreds of listings on more generic auction sites, like ebay, and classified listings like those found on Craigslist. Regardless of what mode of transportation you&#8217;re looking for you&#8217;ll easily find a listing to fit your tastes on the web.<br />
<strong><em>Watches &amp; Jewelry</em></strong><br />
The online secondary market for jewelry and watches is enormous. Because of the longer lifespan of both watches and jewelry it&#8217;s common for original owners to sell their items as they upgrade to newer pieces. Luxury jewelry and watch owners also tend to take very good care of their purchases, which means buyers can often find slightly used items in excellent condition at a significant cost savings. Websites like <a title="JamesEdition.com" href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition.com</a> and ebay frequently have items up for bids that look and function just as well as they did when they were brand new.<br />
<strong><em>Fine Art</em></strong><br />
Much like jewelry and watches, fine art is nearly timeless. While tastes will often vary significantly from one collector to another, the internet has made it east to connect with others around the world who share those unique and specific tastes. Websites like <a title="Artnet.com" href="http://artnet.com" target="_blank">Artnet.com</a> have compiled listings from dealers and individual artists and made them available to collectors worldwide.<br />
<strong><em>Antique &amp; Collectable Firearms</em></strong><br />
Websites like GunBroker.com have made locating rare and unique firearms as simple as a Google search. With a massive dealer and person-to-person online marketplace, firearms collectors now easily connect around the world to buy and sell handguns, rifles, and shotguns. The vast majority of those sales are more everyday hunting rifles and handguns for simple target practice, there are also frequent auctions and listings for pistols, rifles, and shotguns that cost tens of thousands of dollars.<br />
Regardless of your specific areas of interest, if your tastes run to the luxury end of the scale you&#8217;ll be able to find a website that focuses on your hobby. As your average Joe has become comfortable listing common items online, wealthy individuals have followed suit and are now posting their wears in growing numbers.<br />

Unbeknownst to many, items like helicopters, private jets, luxury watches and jewelry, even entire estates are listed on sites like <a href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition.com</a> for those with money to spend, but who also understand the value of a dollar. But with so much at risk with such high dollar items, how can buyers and sellers truly protect themselves against scams?<br />
<strong><em>Use a Reputable Website</em></strong><br />
There are literally dozens of websites that bring together buyers and individual sellers or brokers, but not all of those sites are legitimate. Reputable luxury classified websites like JamesEdition will take the time to properly vet listings and members. When in doubt, contact customer service. If you never receive a response, or the email you receive in reply is filled with grammar errors and broken links you&#8217;ll likely want to look for another site.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve locked in your seller or won your buyer&#8217;s bid. At that point, keeping an open line of communication with the other party can help to head off any potential issues. The vast majority of deals that fall through only do so because of simple misunderstandings that could&#8217;ve easily been ironed out with a phone call or a few additional lines for clarification in a purchase agreement.<br />
<em><strong>Inspection, Inspection, Inspection</strong></em><br />
With luxury items it&#8217;s more important than ever to have potential purchases inspected. Because of the high dollar amounts attached to items like yachts, helicopters, and jewelry there&#8217;s even more for fraudsters to gain through misrepresentation or financial fraud. Once you&#8217;ve won an auction or settled on a price with a potential buyer, the next logical step will be for the buyer to have the item inspected. Sellers shouldn&#8217;t be surprised or feel slighted that a buyer wants to get a second opinion as they would likely want that reassurance themselves. As long as the requirements aren&#8217;t exceptionally off-putting, this is simply the chance for the buyer&#8217;s inspector to confirm what they have already been told by the seller or dealer.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
The most common question we receive during transactions is &#8220;How can I really trust the other party?&#8221; The simplest and clearest way to put a nervous buyer or seller at ease is through the use of escrow. <a title="Luxury Escrow through PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> platforms simply act as a neutral third party to hold and transmit funds between two unknown parties. Buyers are protected as all funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has arrived for a final once over. Sellers are protected because all purchase funds are verified in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds or credit card chargebacks.<br />
When it comes right down to it, most buyers and sellers are better at recognizing potential fraud than they realize. If either party is difficult to contact, refusees to answer additional simple questions, or throws down unreasonable demands it may simply be time to walk away. And, as always, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
