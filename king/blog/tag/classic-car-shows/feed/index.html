<strong><em>Monterrey Car Week &#8211; August 11-17</em></strong><br />
For an entire week, a grouping of perfectly manicured golf courses in Monterrey, California are transformed into some of the most pristine automotive exhibition spaces outside of the Scottsdale Auctions. With collector cars groomed from over 30 car clubs across the U.S., this week-long event boasts nearly 50 events including auctions, scenic rally drives through the Monterrey peninsula, and specialized events focused around specific makes and models. Even with a ticket price of $400, this event is sold out year after year with tickets in high demand from collectors and spectators alike.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the latter half of July, over 80,000 spectators have been regularly gathering on an annual basis to visit our July featured car show. Taking place over three days with dozens of events and thousands are participants, this family-friendly event has quickly become one of the largest and most widely attended car shows on the eastern seaboard.<br />
<strong><em><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headerimage3-03.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1752" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headerimage3-03.png?w=300" alt="headerimage3-03" width="300" height="91" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headerimage3-03.png 1006w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headerimage3-03-300x91.png 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/headerimage3-03-768x234.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Syracuse Nationals</em></strong><br />
Held at the New York State Fairgrounds, for three days the Syracuse Nationals packs the full 365 acres of fairgrounds with all the vehicles of any car lover&#8217;s dreams. Limited to classic cars with a model year prior to 1980 for the bulk of the festival, fans can peruse the 7,500+ participating vehicles at events that include a <a title="Syracuse Nationals Events" href="http://rightcoastcars.com/syracuse-nationals.php" target="_blank">Back Yard Build-Off, Poker Run, Ol&#8217; Skool Roundup, swap meets</a> and more. And for those with a love of hotrod metal born after 1981, there&#8217;s also American Muscle Sunday that showcases some of the more modern additions to the classic car world. Advanced tickets sales are only $5 for adults and $2 for kids, so if you&#8217;re in the northeast and love classic cars you&#8217;re foolish to pass up this enormous gathering of hot rod metal.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warmer weather is FINALLY making its way across the U.S. and hot rod and custom owners are polishing up the chrome for spring car shows. During the warmer months, we&#8217;ve decided to highlight some of the most popular and unique classic car shows from around the country. It only seems appropriate that we would kick things off with a hot rod and custom event that features some of the most iconic images associated with the golden age of cars &#8211; rockabilly and American muscle.<br />
<strong><em>Lone Star Rod &amp; Kustom Round Up</em></strong><br />
Now in its 13th year, the Lone Star Rod &amp; Kustom Round Up has come a long way since it&#8217;s inception. Now sporting over 1,200 vehicles on display and four days of events and concerts, this Austin event has become a must-see for any hot rod or custom fan. Events for this year start with a kickoff BBQ on April 3rd and wrap up with a farewell brunch on April 6th. The bulk of the events takes place on April 4th and 5th including mini-bike races and eight bands. For a better idea of what all happens at the Rod &amp; Kustom Round Up, check out the video below from their 10th annual event.<br />

If there&#8217;s anything you can count on once the weather warms up it would be the rev of muscle cars and motorcycles as owners work out the winter stiffness in gear boxes and transmissions. While we&#8217;re all happily dreaming of warmer days, it only seemed appropriate to highlight some of the best and most popular car shows throughout North America coming up in 2014.<br />
<strong><em><a title="Concours d'Elegance of America" href="http://concoursusa.org/" target="_blank">Concours d’Elegance of America</a> at St. John’s</em></strong><br />
Scheduled for July 27th of 2014, this annual event &#8211; and others that bare the Concours d&#8217;Elegance name &#8211; has deep roots running back to 17th century horse-drawn carriage exhibitions of Paris, France. Continuing the tradition of showcasing some of the most impressive modes of transportation ever created, the Concours d’Elegance at St. John&#8217;s has become a multi-day event that includes a showcase of collector cars, automotive art exhibition and vintage car auction.<br />
<strong><em><a title="Shades of the Past Rod Run" href="http://www.shadesofthepast.com/index.html" target="_blank">Shades of the Past Rod Run</a></em></strong><br />
Held in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., this two day event on September 5th &amp; 6th is an exhibition of pure hot rod muscle. Now in its 32nd year, this event features some of the most impressive hot rod, custom and classic cars on the road. While the majority of the cars at the show are just that &#8211; show cars &#8211; there are a number of collectors and classic car lovers who bring their road-ready hot rods to Pigeon Forge and can be seen cruising the surrounding highways; especially U.S. Route 441.<br />
<strong><em><a title="Charlotte AutoFair" href="http://www.charlotte-autofair.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte AutoFair</a></em></strong><br />
A North Carolina staple, the Charlotte AutoFair is held twice annually &#8211; April 3rd through 6th this year for the Spring Meet and again September 18th through 20th for the Fall Meet. With an anticipated crowd of over 100,000 this is easily one of the largest classic car shows in America. Both events host more than 1,600 classic cars on display, almost all of which are available for purchase.<br />
<strong><em><a title="State Fair of Texas Auto Show" href="http://bigtex.com/fun/autoshow/" target="_blank">State Fair of Texas Auto Show</a></em></strong><br />
As the saying goes, everything is bigger in Texas. Looped into State Fair of Texas, this annual auto show boasts more than 400,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor exhibition space for 2014. Focused more heavily on modern automobiles the show does highlight classics and customs through their <a title="Classic Corral at the State Fair of Texas" href="http://bigtex.com/fun/autoshow/classiccorral/" target="_blank">Classic Corral</a> with various clubs and vehicles separated by make and model featured over the month-long state fair.<br />
<strong><em><a title="Iola Old Car Show" href="http://www.iolaoldcarshow.com/" target="_blank">Iola Old Car Show</a></em></strong><br />
Held in Iola, Wisconsin, this year&#8217;s 41st annual event will open its doors July 10th through 13th. Featuring several thousand classic vehicles, collectors will have the opportunity to peruse over 300 acres of show space. The theme exhibition for 2014 has yet to be determined, but attendees will be treated to an impressive collection of custom and classic cars over the four day event.<br />
Whether you&#8217;re a car collector yourself or simply love the glimmer of chrome in the sunlight, be sure to check with your local car clubs as there are often weekly shows in most areas that feature some amazing vehicles. For a more complete listing, OldCarsWeekly.com has compiled a very thorough <a title="OldCarsWeekly.com Antique, Old &amp; Classic Car Show Calendar" href="http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/showcalendar" target="_blank">listing of car shows by state</a> that&#8217;s updated frequently.</p>
