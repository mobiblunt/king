While these sites do an excellent job of monitoring and vetting users, if you&#8217;re new to online auctions and classified listings the process can be a bit daunting. The tips below can be a great help for buyers new to the online firearms world, and make sure that you aren&#8217;t caught off guard when you&#8217;ve found a used rifle that meets your needs.<br />
<strong><em>Ask Questions</em></strong><br />
Many times new buyers can be bashful when it comes to asking questions for sellers. You should never feel bad about asking too many questions. Veteran sellers will have all kinds of information at their disposal for the items they&#8217;re selling, and more often than not are happy to provide whatever they can. You should also ask questions of any customer service reps that the auction or classified site my provide. If things aren&#8217;t clearly spelled out from either the seller or the website&#8217;s FAQ, ask away!<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s a 50/50 shot as to whether or not a given website will have a secure checkout process. Even if the site does provide a checkout service, you should strongly consider an <a title="Gun Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service for any larger purchase. Online escrow works to protect you AND the seller. Buyers are protected as all funds are held with a neutral third party until there is proof that the rifle has shipped, or has even arrived at your chosen FFL holder for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as your purchase funds are verified and held upfront, completely removing the seller&#8217;s chances of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
<strong><em>Secure a Quality Inspection</em></strong><br />
Unless you happen to be an expert gunsmith you&#8217;ll want to line up an inspection. Companies like WeGoLook.com can schedule an inspector to visit the rifle in question and report back to you what they find. Depending on the specifications of the rifle, you may also want to build in time for you to inspect the rifle yourself once it arrives &#8211; especially if there are any custom components that the previous owner has added themselves.<br />
Ultimately, as the buyer the onus is on you to ensure that what you&#8217;re buying is what you think it is. While any legitimate seller will do their best to work with you on price, shipping and inspections, it&#8217;s up to you as the buyer to educate yourself as thoroughly as possibly on the processes and rifle itself.<br />

Below we&#8217;ve compiled a grouping of some of the most commonly bought and sold items through luxury classified listings and auction sites.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</em></strong><br />
Whether it&#8217;s a cherry classic car, a fishing boat, or an ATV for your summer cabin, vehicles of all shapes and sizes are some of the most common listings you&#8217;ll find online. Most groupings of vehicles will have niche sites dedicated to specific buyers and sellers, but you&#8217;ll also find hundreds of listings on more generic auction sites, like ebay, and classified listings like those found on Craigslist. Regardless of what mode of transportation you&#8217;re looking for you&#8217;ll easily find a listing to fit your tastes on the web.<br />
<strong><em>Watches &amp; Jewelry</em></strong><br />
The online secondary market for jewelry and watches is enormous. Because of the longer lifespan of both watches and jewelry it&#8217;s common for original owners to sell their items as they upgrade to newer pieces. Luxury jewelry and watch owners also tend to take very good care of their purchases, which means buyers can often find slightly used items in excellent condition at a significant cost savings. Websites like <a title="JamesEdition.com" href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition.com</a> and ebay frequently have items up for bids that look and function just as well as they did when they were brand new.<br />
<strong><em>Fine Art</em></strong><br />
Much like jewelry and watches, fine art is nearly timeless. While tastes will often vary significantly from one collector to another, the internet has made it east to connect with others around the world who share those unique and specific tastes. Websites like <a title="Artnet.com" href="http://artnet.com" target="_blank">Artnet.com</a> have compiled listings from dealers and individual artists and made them available to collectors worldwide.<br />
<strong><em>Antique &amp; Collectable Firearms</em></strong><br />
Websites like GunBroker.com have made locating rare and unique firearms as simple as a Google search. With a massive dealer and person-to-person online marketplace, firearms collectors now easily connect around the world to buy and sell handguns, rifles, and shotguns. The vast majority of those sales are more everyday hunting rifles and handguns for simple target practice, there are also frequent auctions and listings for pistols, rifles, and shotguns that cost tens of thousands of dollars.<br />
Regardless of your specific areas of interest, if your tastes run to the luxury end of the scale you&#8217;ll be able to find a website that focuses on your hobby. As your average Joe has become comfortable listing common items online, wealthy individuals have followed suit and are now posting their wears in growing numbers.<br />

Buying and selling both antique and modern firearms online is a tricky business. In addition to abiding by the numerous federal and state guidelines that are in place, shipping to a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL) is an absolute requirement for interstate sales. But earlier this year, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms released a notice about a new scam that is starting to appear on firearms auction and classified sites where sellers will provide fake FFL numbers to buyers, and then simply never deliver the advertised item.<br />
<strong><em>Confirm the FFL Number</em></strong><br />
The first line of defense against these types of scams involves simply verifying the information that the seller gives you. The ATF provides an <a title="FFL eZ Check" href="http://www.atf.gov/content/firearms/firearms-industry/applications-FFL-eZ-check" target="_blank">FFL eZ Check</a> website that allows you to enter in the license number that any FFL holder and confirm whether or not that license is real and active. If you enter the number given by the seller and it comes back as invalid or expired that should be your first red flag. If the given number checks out you&#8217;ll know that the dealer is who they claim to be and that you&#8217;re one step close to ensuring the ad or auction is legitimate.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
Even if you&#8217;ve verified that the seller has an up-to-date and legitimate FFL, you&#8217;ll still want to protect your purchase funds. The simplest way to do that is to use an <a title="Firearms Escrow with PaySAFE" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. Online escrow works to the benefit of both parties by securing and verifying any purchase funds with a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds aren&#8217;t released until there&#8217;s proof of shipping, or the item has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as all purchase funds are verified upfront and held securely &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
<strong><em>What If You&#8217;ve Been Scammed?</em></strong><br />
If you think you&#8217;ve become a victim of a fraudulent FFL scam, report it to your local authorities immediately. Falsifying a FFL is a federal offense, and your local authorities will definitely work with you to pursue legal action to recover your funds if it&#8217;s at all possible. You should also consider filing a report with the <a title="Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov" target="_blank">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> (IC3), and/or the Federal Trade Commission. Both of those organizations can help alert others to the types of scams taking place on the web and help other avoid becoming victims as well.<br />

While some of the most common items in estate sales include furniture, appliances, and other household odds and ends, it&#8217;s not uncommon for collections of firearms to be included as well. Anyone can toss furniture up on an online auction, but firearm estate sales can be difficult if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the process and/or federal regulations. The tips below can help anyone ease into the selling of a firearms collection in an estate.<br />
<strong><em>Price Items Out</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re relatively unfamiliar with the types of firearms in the collection you&#8217;re attempting to sell, start by selecting a few specific handguns or firles and do some price comparison. By seeing what similar firearms are selling for in online auctions you can begin to get an idea of what the entire collection may contain. If you&#8217;re unsure as what types of firearms you&#8217;re dealing with, the NRA Museum has a great step-by-step list that can show you <a title="NRA Museum - What's My Gun Worth" href="http://www.nramuseum.org/gun-info-research/what's-my-gun-worth.aspx" target="_blank">how to identify firearms</a>.<br />
<strong><em>Determine Your Interest Level</em></strong><br />
Let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; you may have zero interest in investing the time and energy required to put together a firearms estate sale. If that&#8217;s the case, you may want to shop around various local auction houses to see what they would charge to liquidate the collection for you. The <a title="Rock Island Auction Company" href="http://www.rockislandauction.com/" target="_blank">Rock Island Auction Company</a> is also a world renowned auction house that specializes specifically in firearms. You may also wish to consult with a local firearms dealer and have them inspect the collection for you. Professional dealers will be able to point out the more valuable items in the collection that may be worth listing individually, and those that would be better sold in groups.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
When dealing with a potentially large amount of cash as the result of a firearms estate sale, it&#8217;s important to protect your funds. <a title="Firearms Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies that specialize in firearms escrow, like PaySAFE, offer great financial protection for both buyers and sellers. Buyers are protected as all purchase funds are held until there&#8217;s proof of shipping, or the items have arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are equally protected as all purchase funds are verified and held up front &#8211; eliminating the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks, and credit card chargebacks. Platforms like PaySAFE also provide a comprehensive history of all approvals and the ability to track any needed documentation, which is especially important for firearms transactions.<br />
The sale of firearms as the result of an inherited estate can be as complex or simple as you would like. From the listing of the firearms individually to selling the entire collection in one lot, sellers have many options at their disposal.

As ecommerce as exploded in popularity over the last decade nearly everything has found a niche retailer or two in the online space. Buying and selling firearms online took a bit longer to gain traction simply due to the nature of the items being sold, but now antique and collector firearms enthusiasts have numerous reputable websites at their disposal. Below we&#8217;ve compiled a listing of some of the top websites for <a title="Firearms Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">buying and selling firearms online</a>. While each has its own unique design and slightly different processes, each site will have a number of similarities.<br />
<a title="GunBroker.com" href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>GunBroker.com</em></strong></a><br />
Our friends at GunBroker.com have been in business for 15 years, and have built a reputation for quality listings and customer service. With listings for handguns, rifles, collectable firearms, ammunition, and numerous other categories, GunBroker.com is truly a one-stop shop for firearms, hunting, fishing and sport shooting enthusiasts. The site&#8217;s search functionality also makes it easy to sort out listings based on manufacturer, caliber, model or any other specified criteria.<br />
<a title="Armslist.com" href="http://armslist.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Armslist.com</em></strong></a><br />
With hundreds of listings categorized first by state, Armslist.com compiles classified listings based on six major categories: firearms, firearms accessories, outdoor gear, other items, events, and services. You can also narrow listings further by selecting a city or region within your state of choice.<br />
<a title="Gunocracy.com" href="http://gunocracy.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Gunocracy.com</em></strong></a><br />
About as straight forward of a firearms website as can be, Gunocracy.com is focused around a more visual search for firearms and accessories. Breaking listings into four main categories &#8211; handguns, rifles, shot guns, and accessories &#8211; users can then specify price ranges, calibers, barrel lengths and manufacturers to narrow down available items from hundreds of listings. Gunocracy.com&#8217;s <a title="GunUp the Magazine - Gunocracy.com" href="http://www.gunupthemagazine.com/" target="_blank">GunUp</a> blog section and Q&amp;A forums also make it easy to connect with other users within the site.<br />
<a title="GunsAmerica.com" href="http://gunsamerica.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>GunsAmerica.com</em></strong></a><br />
Similar search and sorting functions are found on GunsAmerica.com as with the previous sites we&#8217;ve listed, but a much deeper selection of articles and featured gun reviews gives GunsAmerica a slightly different feel. The site also has a clearly labeled section for dealers, and keeps a history of recent classified listings and auctions that you&#8217;ve viewed &#8211; which makes finding recently viewed items even easier.<br />
You should also takes steps to secure your funds when buying through online classified sites like those listed above. <a title="Firearms Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies like PaySAFE work to protect both the buyer and seller by simply holding funds until there is proof that the item has shipped or has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are equally protected as all purchase funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; eliminating the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
Whichever firearms website you may choose, be sure to closely read all the rules and regulations when it comes to creating a listing or bidding on auctions. While most sites will have similar functionality, it&#8217;s the little differences that can sometimes cause issues if you are actively listing or shopping on multiple firearms websites.<br />

While you may have looked long and hard to find your dream hunting rifle, how can you trust that what you pick up from your <a title="How to Find a Local FFL" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/05/21/how-to-find-a-local-ffl/" target="_blank">local FFL</a> will really be what was advertised?<br />
<strong><em>Use a Reputable Website</em></strong><br />
There are literally dozens of websites that bring together buyers and individual sellers or brokers, but not all of those sites are legitimate. Reputable firearms websites like <a title="GunBroker.com Website" href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank">GunBroker.com</a> will often have a buyer or seller protection program that will cover at least a portion of your purchase. When in doubt, contact customer service for the website in question. If you&#8217;re unable to get any type of response, or the email you receive in reply is riddled with spelling errors and broken links, you&#8217;ll likely want to find a new website to buy and sell through.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve locked in your seller or won your buyer&#8217;s bid. At that point, keeping an open line of communication with the other party can help to head off any potential issues. The vast majority of deals that fall through do so because of simple misunderstandings that could&#8217;ve easily been ironed out with a phone call or a few short emails.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
The most common question we receive during transactions is &#8220;How can I really trust the other party?&#8221; The simplest and most transparent way to put a nervous buyer or seller at ease is through the use of escrow. <a title="PaySAFE Firearms Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/firearms-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> platforms simply act as a neutral third party to hold and transmit funds between two unknown parties. Buyers are protected as all funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has arrived for a final once over. Sellers are protected because all purchase funds are verified in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds or credit card chargebacks.<br />
When it comes right down to it, most of us are better at sniffing out a bad deal than we realize. If either party is difficult to contact, continually balks at answering additional questions, or makes ridiculous ultimatums it may simply be time to walk away. And, as always, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />

Ready to step up your game when it comes to your favorite hunting rifle? There are any number of rifles and shotguns that a seasoned hunter can add to their collection that have earned reputations for being exquisite firearms.<br />

<em>Disclaimer: The topics and guidelines discussed in this post pertain to the importing and exporting of firearms in the <strong>United States only</strong>. For regulations governing the import and export of firearms in a country other than the U.S., please consult with your local governing bodies.</em><br />
Online auctions and marketplaces like <a title="GunBroker.com" href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank">GunBroker.com</a> have opened up collector and antique firearms to a global audience. While this is great news when you&#8217;ve got an item up for sale, it can turn quickly turn into a hassle if the buyer lives overseas. While shipping internationally isn&#8217;t impossible, there are strict processes that must be followed anytime you import or export firearms from the United States.<br />
<strong><em>Do Your Homework</em></strong><br />
Firearms laws vary greatly from country to country. As a seller, it&#8217;s important to do some digging should you have a buyer located abroad &#8211; for example it can be nearly impossible to import a handgun in Japan. There are also a number of items that are illegal to import or export from country to country. In the U.S., these items include such things as armor-piercing ammunition, high-capacity magazines and certain items deemed to be considered assault rifles. Because the laws vary so greatly from place to place, you&#8217;ll need to work with an firearms exporting expert who can help you through the process, which bring us to our next topic.<br />
<strong><em>Exporting Firearms from the United States</em></strong><br />
Firearms can only be exported from the United States via a licensed exporter that is located within the United States. Much like businesses or individuals with an Federal Firearms License (FFL), these exporters are properly licensed and have the depth of knowledge needed when working with customs departments around the globe. GunBroker.com has a <a title="List of Firearms Exporters - GunBroker.com" href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Support/SupportFAQView.aspx?FAQID=1110&amp;NoCount=1" target="_blank">list of firearms exporters,</a> or you can check around locally for recommendations or through search engines like Google.<br />
<strong><em>Importing Firearms into the United States</em></strong><br />
Those without a FFL license MAY NOT import any item considered to be a firearm. Any individual with a FFL may import a firearm for personal use or for another individual. While the FFL holder does not need to posses an importer&#8217;s license of occasional imports, there are certain forms that are required:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;">The licensee must first submit a ATF Form 6, Part I to the Imports Branch for approval. </span>The licensee may then present the approved Form 6 and completed ATF Form 6A to the U.S. Customs Service. Contact the Bureau of ATF, Imports Branch, Washington, DC 20226, (202) 927-8320 for forms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Items that may be accessories but are not considered to be actual firearms may be imported without any special consideration or precautions. This would include things like holsters, scopes, ammo bags, etc.<br />
Again, because of the wide variance in rules and regulations, we highly recommend contacting your preferred FFL holder to discuss the item you&#8217;re looking to purchase prior to transferring any funds. Because of the frequency with which regulations can change, these FFL import and export experts can be the difference between securing a great find or spending your cash on fines and lawyer&#8217;s fees.<br />
