								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-car.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2116" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-car.jpg?w=300" alt="Picture of a Rusty Old Car" width="300" height="201" /></a>It&#8217;s often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that you can&#8217;t possibly put a price on love. But when it comes to buying and selling collector items like classic cars sentimental value is hardly the coin of the realm. If you&#8217;re placing an ad on a classified site, or looking to setup and online auction, whether you&#8217;re the buyer or seller it behooves you to have an idea of what a vehicle is worth. Because the condition of the vehicle has a much greater affect on price than rarity alone, a simple rating system for any cars condition has been widely adopted by most auction houses and collectors.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 1</em></strong><br />
These vehicles are in simply the best condition one could ask for. Rarely, if ever, are they driven outside of simply rolling onto the greenery of a concours show. Colors and materials are correct, possibly even original, throughout the vehicle, and every surface gleams like new. These vehicles are the best of the best of the best.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 2</em></strong><br />
Condition two vehicles are condition one vehicles that are a little past their prime. These cars and trucks can still easily win a local or regional show if entered, but owners probably drive condition two vehicles a little more than they should, but any flaws are still only visible upon very close inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 3</em></strong><br />
&#8220;Good&#8221; is probably the best descriptor when you think of condition three vehicles. Cars and trucks in this category are likely driven frequently, have some easily visible flaws or dings, but possess a number of characteristics of condition two vehicles as well. Fading of paint jobs is common, and minor mechanical issues may be present and persistent with these types of classics.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 4</em></strong><br />
Here&#8217;s where things can start to get a little hairy. Condition four vehicles need some work nearly everywhere. Mechanical issues are instantly audible or visible, cosmetic problems are seen even by those with an untrained eye, and previous restoration work is visible. No major parts or pieces are missing, but these types of classics need some love and care to be brought back from some neglect.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 5</em></strong><br />
Complete overhaul. Parts are missing or have been incorrectly retrofitted, paint and other cosmetic pieces show evident wear and tear, and it&#8217;s a 50/50 shot as to whether or not these vehicles will turn over when you twist the key.<br />
<strong><em>Parts or Salvage</em></strong><br />
Just what it sounds like, these cars exist only so that others may feed off of their components. Generally, this category of vehicles is worth about 50% of those in the condition five group.<br />
Why does knowing your chosen car&#8217;s condition group matter? Using the example of a 1957 AC Ace 2-door Roaster, the top condition one pricing suggestion is estimated at $272,000. Moving down just to condition two means a drop in price to $223,000 &#8211; nearly a $50,000 difference. Take that same vehicle down to a condition four, and the price dips all the way to $109,000.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internet technology has brought great change in the classic car industry creating an exciting global market place. Gone are the days of needing a matchmaker such as a dealer or broker. Buyers and sellers as individuals have access to vintage vehicles from all over the country and abroad.  Sellers can now market themselves and buyers can find an extensive inventory. Rare and vintage cars from around the world are available right now on our laptops via online classifieds. As exciting as these new developments are, this global marketplace generates new problems and concerns; namely, fraud.  Private sellers stand to make more on the sale price however now stand alone to handle all risk involved in the transaction. Private buyers risk financial fraud and misrepresentation. Other concerns include the burden of producing a purchase agreement, safe and secure transfer of funds, and the buyers&#8217; risk of vehicle misrepresentation.  One company created specifically to meet the needs of the modern classic car market is<a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow"> PaySAFEescrow.com</a><br />
PaySAFE®  was founded with a vision to change how business was transacted and level the playing field for both sides of a financial exchange. By leveraging technology and traditional banking solutions, PaySAFE provides trust to both buyer and seller.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Buyer, confidence that you will get exactly what you ordered before the seller receives your money.</li>
<li>As a Seller, eliminate the financial risk of scams and fraud. Escrow funds are cleared through the US Banking system.  The seller has no risk of payment fraud, NSF checks or charge backs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the spirit of the DIY model, PaySAFE  provides customers with tools and resources to safely close a deal online.  It&#8217;s ultimately an online closing table providing buyers and sellers a location to create, negotiate and close trades with financial protection.  With PaySAFE  you create and close transactions safely and securely by:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Creating a Purchase agreement</li>
<li>Uploading photos and supporting documents</li>
<li>Tracking communication</li>
<li>Utilizing Escrow service for Financial Security</li>
<li>Buyers: Funds are only released once you have received your vehicle as agreed</li>
<li>Sellers: Eliminate financial fraud and scams while securing the buyer&#8217;s funds upfront</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
PaySAFE customers utilize the service under similar circumstances.  Recently, Joe from Washington decided to part with his prize 2009 GT 500 Mustang. Instead of going to a dealer and haggling on the price he decided to list it online. Within days, Rick from Texas showed interest and they exchanged additional photos via email. Joe felt the deal seemed easy and was about to give Rick his personal banking information so that Rick could wire him the money. Rick on the other hand, had never purchased a car sight unseen and was now being asked to wire an unknown party, 8 states away, $45,000 and hope the same car he viewed in the pictures was the same car that showed up at his home in 10 days. Rick was about to let the deal go and keep searching locally when his car collecting neighbor suggested that they use PaySAFE as a neutral third party to hold the purchase price until the shipping company verifies the car&#8217;s existence. Joe also agreed to use PaySAFE because he knew that Rick&#8217;s money was being held in escrow and would be released once the car was picked up. Additionally, Joe would never need to give his personal banking information to Rick.<br />
This transaction example plays out everyday at PaySAFE. Private buyers and sellers are looking for protection while selling long distance via the internet. PaySAFE eliminates all possibility of fraud because a transaction would never be activated if the buyer doesn&#8217;t fund it, and the seller would never agreed to escrow if they didn&#8217;t have the vehicle to present. PaySAFE&#8217;s President, Matt Medlock describes their service as &#8220;keeping honest people honest&#8221;
</div>
<div>The pros and cons of this changing market continues to be discussed and forward looking companies like <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow">PaySAFEescrow.com</a> aim to solve and simplify a portion of these concerns.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time of year when car collectors pull their classic cars out of storage, polish them up, and go for a cruise. The destination doesn&#8217;t matter but being seen does!  Which also makes this a common time of year to <em>buy</em> a classic car.<br />
Newcomers buying a classic car face a potentially confusing first-time experience.  What car should I buy?  Where should I buy it? (<a href="http://www.fossilcars.com/">Fossilcars.com</a> and <a href="http://www.oldcaronline.com">OldCarOnline.com</a> are amazing resources for classic car enthusiasts on the look out for that perfect collectible)  How do I know I’m paying the right price? (<a href="http://www.hagerty.com/valuationtools">Hagerty.com</a> your valuation resource)<br />
Some typical advice for new collectors would include starting slowly, joining a classic car club and seeking advice from experienced members, doing research into pricing trends for your favorite model and, of course, not spending more than you can afford.  Most classic-car magazines focus on the expensive end of the spectrum but there&#8217;s just as much fun to be had with a low-cost cruiser.  Determine how you want to use the car.  Will it be for daily driving, to enjoy on weekends, or as an investment? You might be expecting too much if you want to drive your classic every day or sell it for big profit somewhere down the road. Get a car you’re going to enjoy&#8230;something you’re going to drive on weekends, to a local car show or cruise night.<br />
Once you&#8217;ve established <span style="text-decoration:underline;">why</span> you want to buy a classic car, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">what</span> classic car should you buy?  <em><a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow?p=blogfirsttime">PaySAFE</a>  puts t</em><em>he question to our community of car enthusiasts to see what they think&#8230;</em><br />
<strong><em>What do you think is a great classic car for a first time buyer?</em></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jerry, who lives in Missouri, found a beautiful 1964 Dodge Polara 500 Convertible for sale on an online classifieds website from a seller in Pennsylvania. After exchanging a few emails and phone calls, Jerry new he wanted the car, but was still hesitant at the idea of simply sending a check to a relative stranger, especially when the price tag of the Polara was nearly $50,000. He wanted to make sure everything about the classic car met the description the seller provided &#8212; to a T. That&#8217;s why he turned to PaySAFE, which provided peace of mind that his money was secure until he received the car.<br />
The seller was also happy to use PaySAFE, as both parties needed to agree to the details of the transaction before it was officially completed, as PaySAFE gets financial commitment from the buyer upfront, making sure the seller gets paid on time, protecting him from payment fraud.<br />
Both Jerry and the seller in Pennsylvania found that setting up the transaction was easy using PaySAFE&#8217;s paperwork-free online tools. After they both agreed to PaySAFE&#8217;s terms of use, the transaction was ready to be completed.<br />
Learn more on how to <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/09/06/how-to-create-a-paysafe-transaction/">create a PaySAFE transaction</a>.<br />
As the transaction unfolded, Jerry and the seller were able to exchange messages via PaySAFE’s private communication board. Once all the details were agreed upon by both parties, the transaction was complete — and until this final point, no money was exchanged. Once again, PaySAFE leveled the playing field for both the buyer and seller.<br />
Now Jerry is showing off his slick Polara convertible to his friends at the local car shows. Meanwhile, the seller is happy to have received the payment in a secure and timely manner, and is putting the money into restoring more classic cars for future sales.<br />
