The last two months of each year we all take a step back and enjoy the time we have with friends and family. It&#8217;s also a time of year that involves the largest uptick in shopping for many families as we purchase tasty treats and gifts for Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas and numerous other occasions. Unfortunately, this time of year also sees a spike in the number of scams &#8211; both online and off &#8211; that can ruin anyone&#8217;s holiday. So, to keep your yuletide merry, follow some of the simple fraud prevention tips below.<br />
<a href="http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/11/24/how-to-avoid-holiday-travel-scams/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Flight/Travel Scams:</em></strong></a><br />
With family and friends strung across the country, most Americans will do at least a little bit of traveling this holiday season. Scammers know this as well, and will often send offer of &#8216;free airfare&#8217; via email, fax or snail mail. These letters will often bare logos with striking resemblances to legitimate airlines or travel sites, but are actually phishing schemes designed to steal your personal information and/or credit card numbers. Always be sure to call and validate a deal that seems too good to be true, and NEVER give out your personal or banking information via email.<br />
<em><strong>Online Shopping Scams:</strong></em><br />
Cyber Monday is arguably the largest day of online shopping in the world. As we take the the web for great deals, scammers take to the web as well. Be sure to shop only on websites that offer Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protection or that bare the verification of third-party organizations like the Better Business Bureau or TRUSTe. Using your credit card also provides a layer of protection as you can easily contest any suspicious charges.<br />
<em><strong>Charity Scams:</strong></em><br />
Sadly, in a season of giving there are those who would take advantage of our good nature for their own purposes. There are many &#8216;sound alike&#8217; charities that pop up around the holidays. Use of the words &#8216;salvation&#8217; or &#8216;cancer&#8217; don&#8217;t always mean that a charity is legitimate. Giving online can also have pitfalls. Simply because a website ends with a .org doesn&#8217;t mean that the organization is an actual 501c(3) charity. When in doubt, call your charity of choice directly or visit them in person to make your holiday donations.<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=door-to-door+holiday+scams" target="_blank"><em><strong>Door-to-Door Scams:</strong></em></a><br />
Despite the cold weather in most of the country, this time of year sees an increase in door-to-door scams as well. These scammers will often pose as the on the ground representatives of charitable organizations or even tradespeople. Don&#8217;t fall victim to high-pressure sales techniques or sob stories that they may present. Again, when in doubt, tell them you&#8217;ll call the company yourself or give in-person at the organization&#8217;s local office. Some states also require a peddler&#8217;s license when selling door-to-door. Be sure to know the rules in your state and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for identification or proof that individuals are actually working with the company or organization they claim to represent.<br />
While <a title="Holiday Season Scams on Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/10/credit-cards-gifts-charity-internet-personal-finance-holiday-scams_slide_11.html" target="_blank">holiday season scams</a> don&#8217;t tend to vary greatly in substance when compared to the rest of the calendar year, these types of risks do tend to increase during the holidays. However, keeping tabs on your local news and following the tips above can help to keep your holidays season free of bad tidings.</p>

While November and December are obvious months when online shoppers should keep their guard up, in recent years there has been a significant uptick in financial and identity theft attempts around Valentine&#8217;s Day as well. Following the simple tips below can help to ensure that your Valentine&#8217;s Day shopping around the web doesn&#8217;t end in financial heartbreak.<br />
<strong><em>Be Wary of Dating Sites</em></strong><br />
Those looking for love are often feeling a little extra lonely this time of year. Scammers know this as well, and will often take advantage of those that are maybe a little too desperate to find that perfect someone. If you happen to strike up a conversation with someone through an online dating website, take the same pause that you would when shopping for a high dollar item like a classic car or luxury watch. As you communicate with the other person, a definite red flag should be an avoidance of conversation anywhere other than via email. While it&#8217;s prudent to be cautious when communicating with strangers on the web, it&#8217;s also odd to not eventually move that conversation to the phone, or even in-person.<br />
<strong><em>Phishing Scams</em></strong><br />
Similar to the routines run by criminals during the holiday season, many scammers will send out emails dressed in the guise of an online retailer or shipping company. If you receive an email that just doesn&#8217;t look quite right, or comes from an email address you don&#8217;t recognize, NEVER click on any embedded links. Many browsers will allow you to preview any hyperlinked text by simply scrolling over the text. Before you click, look toward the bottom left-hand site of your browser window to see where that link will send you.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Fall Too Fast</em></strong><br />
Love at first site is always possible, but be cautious if anyone on a dating website professes love right out of the gate. We all hope that that perfect someone is out there, but if something seems too good to be true it probably is. These claims of love are often followed by a deep desire to visit the other party in person, but they&#8217;re unable to due to financial hardship. Scammers will then ask their targets to wire money directly, or send a personal check so that they can then make the trip to visit. Of course, that trip never happens, and the target is out whatever funds were sent.<br />
Nobody wants to assume that every chance at love could be someone simply trying to scam them out of money, but taking the time to pause and reflect on any &#8220;too good to be true&#8221; scenario this time of year is a smart move.<br />

With each site requiring a password, it can be very tempting to simply repeat the same password often, or keep all of your passwords simple, but simple and often repeated passwords can be easy prey for hackers and online fraudsters. To ensure that your online accounts and the personal or financial information associated with each is kept safe, we&#8217;ve lined up six tips below to help keep your passwords strong.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Repeat Passwords</em></strong><br />
It may seem somewhat simple, but you should never repeat the exact same password for multiple logins. While you may want to use the same root word or number, it&#8217;s imperative that you add some unique characters to each account. Using this approach, hackers may be able to compromise a single account, but will have difficulty gaining access to other sites.<br />
<strong><em>Use Long, Sentence-Based Passwords</em></strong><br />
When most people think of passwords they think of a single word or combination of letters, but the only real limit to your passwords are character restrictions. Using an entire sentence of short phrase as your password can make your accounts extremely difficult to access for outside parties. Making the sentence extremely personal, like &#8220;I grew up in Omaha,&#8221; or &#8220;My college major was communications&#8221; can make your accounts inaccessible for anyone but you.<br />
<strong><em>Use Two-Step Verification</em></strong><br />
To add an extra layer of protection, websites like Facebook and Gmail have begun to offer two-step verification. This safety measure requires a second, non-web based verification before accounts can be access, or passwords changed. Most often, the service will send a text message with an access code to a mobile device. This way, if you aren&#8217;t the one requesting the password change, you would be notified that someone else is attempting to do so.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Easily Found Information</em></strong><br />
Many of us have a various pieces of personal information scattered around in public documents. Things like birth dates, maiden names, or names of children and relatives can be found somewhat easily by those who know where to look. Avoiding passwords based on that type of information is recommended.<br />
<strong><em>Change Passwords Regularly</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve ever worked in an office that deals with sensitive information, your IT team likely required a password change every three to six months. We recommend changing the passwords for your most sensitive personal accounts regularly as well. You can make it easy to remember by tying a password change to a regularly occurring event, like when you change your car&#8217;s air filter or after each dental visit.<br />
<strong><em>Use Pneumonic Devices</em></strong><br />
In elementary school we were all taught different tricks to help recall information that is difficult to remember off the cuff &#8211; like the order of the planets or multiplication tables. You can do the same thing when your passwords. For example, the phrase &#8220;This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8221; would translate to a password of TIWWCHNT. That nonsensical jumble of letters would be difficult for anyone to guess.<br />
While there may not be a 100% foolproof method to keep your passwords out of the hands of hackers, the six tips above can ensure that you&#8217;re on the right path to keeping your personal and financial information safe.

From cars to firearms, fine art to snowmobiles, online classified websites and auction platforms are no longer the purview of only the most tech savvy users. However, as more and more consumers have moved into the online space scammers have followed. Protecting your finances against fraud when buying and selling online is more important than ever, and the tips below can help you ensure that your financial information stays safe.<br />
<strong><em>Use More Than Email</em></strong><br />
The most common way that online auctions and transactions begin is through email. Either by reaching out to an email address listed on a classified site like Craigslist, or following up after a closed ebay auction, most users never think twice about email only conversations. However, one of the easiest ways to sift out the legitimate buyers and sellers from the scammers is to follow up on the phone or in person. If the other party insists that email is the ONLY method by which they&#8217;re willing to communicate it should be taken as a red flag.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds</em></strong><br />
After you&#8217;ve taken the time to verify that the other party is legitimate you&#8217;ll want to find a safe way to transmit funds between both parties. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com">Online escrow</a> is the most secure way to transfer funds between two relatively unknown parties. Buyers are protected because funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are also protected as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Use Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If at all possible provide documentation from a third party, or be willing to allow the buyer to verify information through an inspection of their own. Unless you happen to be an expert in whatever is being bought or sold the only way to be sure that an items is what it&#8217;s advertised to be is to have a professional give their seal of approval. This is especially important with sports memorabilia, fine art, and other more easily forged items.<br />
<strong><em>Never Transmit Account Numbers</em></strong><br />
Unless you&#8217;re 100% positive that you can trust the second party you should never share banking or other financial information online. Scammers need relatively small amounts of information to begin clearing out your accounts once they have the account number. Using a third party to transmit funds that shields financial information between the two parties is one of the safest and most secure ways to buy and sell online.<br />
Believe it or not, but most consumers are smarter than they realize when it comes to sniffing out a scam. Trusting your instincts when something seems a bit off and asking the right questions can save you countless hours of time and stress &#8211; and if something seems to good to be true, it generally is.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scam-keyboard.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1990" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scam-keyboard.jpg?w=300" alt="scam keyboard" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scam-keyboard.jpg 630w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scam-keyboard-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As we&#8217;ve discussed in some previous <a title="BBB Top Ten Scams" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/07/08/bbb-top-ten-scams/">posts about online scams</a>, the most common ways that scammers will attempt to insert themselves into your life is through email. Nowadays, it seems that everyone is receiving the bulk of their financial information in their email inbox. Banking statements, credit card statements, utility bills, mortgage statements &#8211; nearly all of these pop up monthly in your gmail or Yahoo! account. So, with so much important information being transmitted over the web, how can you tell the legitimate emails from the fake ones?<br />
<strong><em>1. Huge Numbers of Recipients</em></strong><br />
If a scammer has compromised someone&#8217;s email account one of the first things they&#8217;ll often do is to blast malware-containing emails out to that user&#8217;s entire contact list. Because of this, the scammers will often have additional compromised email addresses at their disposal before the originally compromised account owner even knows what&#8217;s going on. If you happen to receive a message from someone with dozens of other people copied in as well, be very wary of clicking any links within the email itself.<br />
<strong><em>2. Huge Number of Links or Hidden Links</em></strong><br />
The ultimate goal of most email scams is to have the recipients click on a link that will either reveal private information or install malware onto the recipient&#8217;s system. So, if you receive an email with more links than written copy, be careful. Often times with scam emails the entire body of the email will just be one giant link. Thankfully, many web browsers like Chrome and Mozilla will allow you to preview any link before actually clicking. Simply scroll your mouse over the link in question and the browser will show you the full URL that that link is directing you to &#8211; generally either next to the cursor arrow or toward the bottom, left-hand side of the browser window. If you don&#8217;t recognize the destination link, DO NOT CLICK.<br />
<strong><em>3. Grammar and Spelling Gaffs</em></strong><br />
Not many people will write grammatically flawless emails &#8211; especially if they&#8217;re in a hurry. But scam emails that originate in foreign countries will often contain obvious and uncommon spelling and grammar errors. Misspellings of a company&#8217;s full name, everyday words, and sporadic capitalization should all be red flags if the email in question is being presented as a formal communication from a business. When in doubt, call the company or individual that supposedly sent you the email to confirm whether or not it was actually sent by them.<br />
<strong><em>4. Obvious Get-Rich-Quick Schemes</em></strong><br />
Anytime someone sends out a message that promises ways for you to get rich quick, attract any sexual partner you desire, or increase the size of your anatomy are obvious ploys that pray on individual insecurities. Like countless relatives and parents have taught you: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
<strong><em>5. Strange or Inappropriate Requests</em></strong><br />
Rarely will your best friend or sister shoot you an email to ask for a few thousand dollars, or to float them some cash for an emergency medical procedure. Scammers know that some people are likely to throw caution to the wind if they believe that their loved ones are in danger or dire need. If you get an email from someone close to you that requests anything that seems out of place, take a few minutes to call them directly and see if the situation is truly as it seems. Not only could you save yourself some time and money, but they&#8217;ll likely appreciate the call and knowing you were so concerned.<br />
The most powerful weapon you have in your arsenal to combat email scams is common sense. Most of the scenarios listed above are designed to outright trick you, or blow away your everyday defenses by presenting dangerous and outlandish scenarios. Taking the time to stop, think, and confirm anything that seems amiss can help ensure that your next suspicious emails stops at the inbox and never reaches your bank accounts.<br />

Very subtle differences from one collectable to another can drastically alter the overall value of the item, and the market is frequently flooded with forged pieces &#8211; especially during the resurgence of teams or individuals. If sports memorabilia is your game, keeping an eye out for some of the common scams listed below can help you avoid becoming a victim of collectables fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Bloated Quality Rankings</em></strong><br />
Nearly all collectables are ranked on some sort of scale, be it 1 to 10, A through F, or any other combination. Some ranking authorities are always above board and lend an equally critical eye to each piece that collectors submit, but some rating agencies are softer than others. Depending on the type of collectables you&#8217;re shopping for, learn the rating agencies of repute and those that may hand out liberal top scores. Sadly, it&#8217;s not always a case of apples to apples.<br />
<strong><em>Trade Show Only Vendors</em></strong><br />
Memorabilia shows travel the country constantly. Most of the vendors at these shows are above board, but there are always sharks among the guppies. Some of these vendors are really collectors in disguise. In addition to their attempts to low ball any potential purchases, these vendors will often have no ties to the real world. So, if you are able to discern that you&#8217;ve purchased a fake item from one of these show vendors there&#8217;s no possible way for you to follow up or track them down. The best place for any serious collector to shop is a trusted and established brick and mortar collector&#8217;s storefront.<br />
<strong><em>Straight Up Fakes and Forgeries</em></strong><br />
These are the most common scams that any collectors will come across. Faked signatures, artificially aged baseballs and mitts, forged championship rings &#8211; there&#8217;s always a scammer looking to take advantage of rabid fans. The easiest way to protect again these types of scams are to have an established expert in your corner. If you don&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to learning all the ins and outs of what constitutes a forgery find someone who already has that knowledge at the ready.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Upfront</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re buying online through an auction or classifieds site, you should also be using online escrow. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller by holding funds as a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there&#8217;s proof that the item has shipped, or it has even arrived and you&#8217;ve had the chance verify it&#8217;s condition. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
While it&#8217;s impossible to know the mind and reputation of every buyer or seller on the web, keeping an eye out for the common scams listed above can help you head off any bad deals at the pass.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2197 size-full" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fraud_crossword-300x183.jpg" width="300" height="183" />Nobody likes planning for worst case scenarios, but preparing for the worst can help save you time and money. When buying or selling collectables, jewelry, or firearms through online auction or classified sites, there are a few things you should watch out for. The tips below can help you spot fraudulent or doctored items.<br />
<strong><em>Inspection, Inspection, Inspection</em></strong><br />
In real estate it&#8217;s all about location, but when buying or selling online it&#8217;s all about inspections. Provide any possible certificates of authenticity for collectables, appraisals from certified gem experts, and documentation for any collector firearm. The more information that you provide, or that is provided to you, the easier it will be for you or the other party to verify that information with another expert.<br />
<strong><em>Secure Your Funds &#8211; Lock In Sales</em></strong><br />
Consider using an<a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank"> online escrow</a> company to secure funds for your next transaction. Escrow companies work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller by acting as a neutral third party to hold and transmit funds. Buyers are protected as funds are held with a third party and only released when they have proof of shipping or the item has arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are protected as well as funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks, and credit card chargebacks.<br />
<strong><em>Consider an Intermediary</em></strong><br />
A common scam &#8211; especially for jewelry &#8211; is for the buyer to receive the item, swap out the precious stones for fakes, and then return the item claiming that it was fake to begin with or that it wasn&#8217;t as described in the ad. Now the original owner is out the precious stone with no way to prove it was genuine to begin with. To combat this type of scam, consider a similar approach as those who ship firearms by shipping to a jewelry inspector as an intermediary. The inspector verifies the item as it&#8217;s shipped to the buyer and then if the items are shipped back, they verify them again to ensure no switcheroo took place. You can use this same process when shipping any items of value.<br />
While some of the processes described above can take a little extra time to complete, they work for the benefit of both parties in any transactions where the buyer and seller are relative unknowns to each other. Taking some time for additional inspections or to draft up a proper purchase agreement that outlines payment and shipping expectations can not only save you time and money but can preserve a sale that may have gone south over simple misunderstandings or gaps in communication.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1956" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady.jpg?w=300" alt="Frustrated Woman at Computer With Stack of Paper" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady.jpg 500w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scammed-lady-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There&#8217;s nothing worse than that moment of realization when you know you&#8217;ve been taken advantage of. Unfortunately, most of us will likely fall victim to some sort of online scam in our lifetime. Be it an errant click of a pop-up banner or a Craigslist poster selling imaginary goods, scams come in all shapes and sizes. But once you realize you&#8217;ve become a victim how can you attempt to minimize the damage?<br />
<strong><em>Call Your Credit Card Company and Bank</em></strong><br />
Priority one is to stop any potential abuse of your credit or bank accounts by scammers. If you suspect or know that you&#8217;ve fallen victim, contact your financial institution&#8217;s customer service or fraud line immediately so that they can begin monitoring your accounts. Depending on the severity of the scam, you may even need to cancel your credit/debit cards completely and start over from scratch.<br />
<strong><em>Gather Records</em></strong><br />
Stop any further communication with the potential fraudster and start gathering up all the information you can. Email addresses, phone numbers, names, descriptions of the goods they attempting to buy or sell &#8211; all of these pieces of the puzzle can help law enforcement begin to track any potential scammers. Depending on the nature of the scam, you may also need this information to share with financial institutions or insurance companies should you be able to recover any goods or funds.<br />
<strong><em>File a Police Report</em></strong><br />
Due to the proliferation of online scam and fraud, many police departments have a cyber or internet crimes specialist. Major credit agencies and most banks will also want a copy of a police report for their records as well. Unless the scammer is directly threatening you or another individual DO NOT CALL 911. Simply call the non-emergency number for your local police department and ask to speak to someone who handles internet or cyber crimes.<br />
<strong><em>Consider a &#8220;Credit Freeze&#8221;</em></strong><br />
In addition to <a title="ConsumerFinance.gov - Credit Assistance" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1375/i-may-have-been-victim-fraud-or-identity-theft-how-can-i-put-fraud-alert-my-credit-report.html" target="_blank">filing a victim fraud report with the three major credit bureaus</a>, you may also want to consider a credit freeze. Used mostly in conjunction with identity theft, a credit freeze will stop any unauthorized individuals from opening new credit accounts in your name. When speaking with each respective credit bureau, they will provide you with a personal identification number (PIN) that will be required whenever anyone attempts to open a new credit account in your name. Unless the person has that unique PIN no new accounts can be opened.<br />
<strong><em>File a Complaint with the IC3</em></strong><br />
The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a central database created by the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center that is accessible to all local, regional and federal law enforcement agencies. <a title="Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">Filing a report with IC3</a> can help alert authorities of the type of scam you have experienced, and potentially compile and compare your situation against others that may have experienced a similar scam.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Future Online Activities</em></strong><br />
In the future, consider an <a title="Prevent Fraud with PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>, like PaySAFE, to help remove the risk of fraud. Online escrow companies act as a neutral third party to hold funds when buyers and sellers are relative unknowns to each other. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has even arrived for a final inspection. Sellers are protected as all funds are verified and securely held with the escrow company &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no big secret that online fraud and scams are running 24/7. Phishing schemes, identity theft, data breaches &#8211; all of these phrases have become somewhat commonplace in headlines and news recaps every evening, but did you really know the extent to which online fraud attempts really happen? A company called ThreatMetrix has compiled a pretty amazing <a href="http://www.threatmetrix.com/threatmetrix-labs/web-fraud-map/" target="_blank">real-time map that shows fraud attempts against the users they protect</a>.<br />
While the screenshot of the map below only shows the attempts against accounts that TreatMetrix monitors, there are certainly more attempts taken than what&#8217;s shown through the company&#8217;s data. For more information on how you can protect yourself from online scams and financial fraud, be sure to read through some of our other posts like <a title="9 Ways to Protect Yourself From Internet Fraud" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/10/31/9-ways-to-protect-yourself-from-internet-fraud/" target="_blank">9 Ways to Protect Yourself from Internet Fraud</a> and <a title="5 Simple Ways to Protect Your Privacy Online" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/11/5-simple-ways-to-protect-your-privacy-online/" target="_blank">5 Simple Ways to Protect Your Privacy Online</a>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, the Better Business Bureau publishes a <a href="https://www.bbb.org/vancouver-island/news-centre/news-releases/2017/02/top-10-scams-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Scams of the year list</a> to drive awareness of the variety of methods in which scammers take advantage of consumers. The BBB top 10 scam list includes the most reported scams of the prior year, providing consumers with tips. Click the BBB infographic below to learn more.</p>
<p>Here, in brief, are tips to protect yourself from falling victim to the BBB&#8217;s top ten scams:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hoax News</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t believe everything you read.</li>
<li><strong>Online Loans</strong> &#8211; Research any lender with the BBB to ensure they are reputable.</li>
<li><strong>Bogus Customs &amp; Delivery Charges</strong> &#8211; Keep track of packages you send and are sent.</li>
<li><strong>Fake Apps</strong> &#8211; Research apps before downloading them from your phone&#8217;s app store. Never click an unsolicited email or texted link to download an app.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Subscriptions</strong> &#8211; Read the fine print on trial offers. Do not provide payment information without first understanding the contract into which you&#8217;re entering.</li>
<li><strong>Phishing Imposters</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t open emails or click links that are texted to you by an unknown party.</li>
<li><strong>Lottery &amp; Prize Winner Scams</strong> &#8211; Never wire money or provide your credit card information to claim a prize. Legitimate lotteries do not require winners to pay fees.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party Application Services</strong> &#8211; Do not provide your personal information to an application completion service without first ensuring their legitimacy.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Support Scams</strong> &#8211; Never trust unsolicited contact from scammers pretending to represent your computer manufacturer.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Money Transfers</strong> &#8211; Never wire money or share credit card or banking information with strangers.</li>
</ol>
