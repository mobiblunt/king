Unfortunately, when it comes to buying and selling items online, there are scam artists and fraudsters that try to cash in on people&#8217;s trusting nature. The only way to be 100% certain that what is advertised in an online classified or auction is legitimate is to have a professional lend their skills through an inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
The safest way to have a vehicle, boat, or any other advertised item inspected &#8211; aside from inspecting the item yourself &#8211; is to take advantage of the services offered by third party inspection companies like <a title="Inspections by WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook.com</a>. The main advantage of a third party inspection company is that the inspector has no skin in the game whatsoever. Inspections provided by the seller can potentially be biased, just as inspections completed by the buyer&#8217;s preferred party can be skewed as well. By removing any potential bias, third party inspectors can give the most complete and trustworthy inspections for any item on the market.<br />
<strong><em>Trust the Professionals</em></strong><br />
Another reason to ensure that you get an inspection for any item comes down to knowledge. Unless you happen to be an expert mechanic, jeweler, or gunsmith, odd are good that you simply don&#8217;t have the depth of knowledge required to complete a thorough inspection. There are some people who devote their entire careers to researching the minutia of their chosen trade, and only those individuals will be able to give you a complete assessment of many unique or rare items listed on online classifieds and auction websites.<br />
<strong><em>Avoid Buying Blind</em></strong><br />
Because the internet has opened up a vast marketing for all types of goods there&#8217;s always the chance that the item your researching isn&#8217;t anywhere near your home. While the seller may provide all kinds of photos and reassurances that the ad is 100% accurate, are you willing to drop several thousand dollars on their word alone? Having a third party inspector from companies like WeGoLook.com take a visit in your stead allows you to avoid buying blind and just hoping that what shows up at your doorstep is what&#8217;s it supposed to be.<br />
<strong><em>Reliable Funds Transfer</em></strong><br />
While having an inspection is always good for the buyer, that may not be the case for the seller. As a show of good faith, considering using an online escrow service to prove your good intentions as well. Online escrow holds and verifies funds upfront and simply holds those funds with a neutral third party until you give the go ahead to transfer the funds to the seller. Buyers are protected as funds aren&#8217;t moved until the inspector verifies the item, or it has already shipped. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card charge backs.<br />
When it comes to inspections it&#8217;s always smart to go with the pros. Our friends at WeGoLook.com have the reliable and trustworthy inspectors that you can rely on to provide a thorough inspection of whatever you might be looking to buy. For more about the services that WeGoLook.com offers, be sure to check out the inspection services section of their site.<br />

While there has been much discussion over the last 12 months or so regarding what Alibaba&#8217;s IPO would mean for ecommerce companies in the U.S., a number of other outlets have also taken a look at one of Alibaba&#8217;s subsidiaries &#8211; Alipay &#8211; that has integrated escrow into the backbone of its payment services. But before we get into what that integration of <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> could mean for other ecommerce payment methods, let&#8217;s take a look at the four main companies that comprise the Alibaba group.<br />
<strong>AliPay</strong> &#8211; AliPay is the number one method of payment for online goods in China. Essentially a copycat of PayPal, Alipay&#8217;s major differentiation is that it offers an escrow service &#8211; unlike PayPay &#8211; as a means to boost confidence in its platform for buyers and seller looking to enter into a new market.<br />
<strong>Alibaba.com</strong> &#8211; This is the Alibaba group&#8217;s B2B powerhouse. The site connects manufacturers direct to purchases for any myriad of products, and is the largest business-to-business platform in the world with over 7 million retailers.<br />
<strong>TMall</strong> &#8211; Essentially a way for retailers to sell direct to consumers, TMall has been the site used to introduce major like Nike and Apple to the Chinese market. The most similar business operated here in the U.S. would be Amazon with its brand-specific storefronts.<br />
<strong>Taobao</strong> &#8211; An online auction site similar to eBay, Taobao is the C2C arm of the Alibaba group. With auctions that allow for reserve prices and regular bidding, this consumer-to-consumer juggernaut uses Alipay as its payment platform of choice.<br />
<strong><em>So What Does Alibaba&#8217;s IPO Mean?</em></strong><br />
Last year alone, Alibaba&#8217;s group of companies transacted nearly $300 billion in goods &#8211; more than the entire U.S. ecommerce segment processed for 2013. Aside from the fact that Alibaba group&#8217;s IPO was also the largest in NYSE history, the company&#8217;s entrance into a U.S. exchange could signify an interest in expanding their business footprint beyond China&#8217;s borders.<br />
Should AliPay also begin to establish itself in western markets it could also mean the buoying of escrow to a more prominent place among other payment methods &#8211; a process now sometimes seen as an afterthought despite the fact that escrow offers exceptional financial protections for online transactions as compared to current payment methods. To truly compete on an even playing field, it would be great to see another online payment processor, like PayPal, integrate escrow to the same level that AliPay has. As they say, a rising tide raises all ships, and lifting U.S.-based escrow companies to a more prominent level would help both payment processors and consumers alike.<br />
The easiest way for ecommerce companies to protect themselves against a potential onslaught of competition from Alibaba&#8217;s four major sites would be to mimic the offerings of those sites just as Alibaba has mimicked other successful .coms. Look no further than 11 Main, the first site the Alibaba group has launched geared for a western market, for an example of how their teams are beginning to shape storefronts. To take a page from Alibaba&#8217;s playbook, U.S. ecommerce retailers could simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on a way to connect manufacturers and purchasers</li>
<li>Offer secure and reliable payment methods</li>
<li>Consider adding escrow as an accepted and/or preferred method of payment</li>
<li>Make international transactions easier to complete</li>
<li>Keep a strong consumer focus</li>
</ul>
<p>With the five tactics mentioned above, any advantage offered through one or all of the Alibaba-owned sites is negated. While the Alibaba group is no tame kitten, the elements of business in which they excel are all easily attainable for other web-based businesses with talented dev teams, or access to agile and capable partnerships.</p>

You won your bid on eBay or negotiated a successful price on ClassicCars.com, GunBroker.com or one of the many other consumer marketplaces around the web. Now that you&#8217;ve secured your prize, what&#8217;s next? Have you decided how to pay the seller? Was shipping part of the deal you negotiated? Closing the auction or negotiating a price is just the start&#8230; now you have to close the transaction safely and securely.<br />
<strong><em>Agree on Payment</em></strong><br />
Many auctions sites will list ways in which the seller is agreeable to being paid, but don&#8217;t actually provide a payment process. If the seller is agreeable or if you&#8217;re unable to pickup the item in person, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow services</a> are an excellent way to protect both the buyer and seller through the payment and shipping process &#8211; especially if both parties are separated by large distances and are relative unknowns to each other.<br />
While wiring funds directly may seem like a good idea, escrow allows for funds to be held securely until there is proof that the purchased items has either shipped or arrived safely at its final destination. It also protects the seller from the risk of insufficient funds or credit card charge backs by verifying and holding the total purchase price securely in a third party escrow account.<br />
<strong><em>Price &amp; Schedule Shipping</em></strong><br />
Shipping costs will vary wildly depending on what you&#8217;ve purchased. Shipping a car or RV is very different from simply packaging a watch or cell phone, so be sure to shop around when it comes to selecting a shipper. Companies like <a href="http://www.uship.com/vehicles/?r=2824374" target="_blank">uShip.com</a> can help arrange shipping for any number of items, while others &#8211; like <a title="Montway Vehicle Shipping" href="http://montway.com" target="_blank">Montway.com</a> &#8211; specialize in verticals like vehicle shipping or freight. Once the shipping has been squared away, it&#8217;s important to communicate and tracking or receipt numbers to both parties.<br />
<strong><em>Pay Your Tab</em></strong><br />
Once you have the payment method and shipping all lined up, there&#8217;s nothing left to do but pull the trigger! Keeping open lines of communication an documenting messages throughout the entire process is imperative. Payment and document tracking platforms like PaySAFE can be a real life saver as all communications and financial processes are time-stamped and logged in a transaction history that both parties can access during and after the transaction itself.<br />
