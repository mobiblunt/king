And not only should those living in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and surrounding areas worry, these cars are easy to ship and will likely end up for sale all over the country.<br />
Being submerged in water can cause a number of problems for a car, affecting brakes, clutch, accelerator, electrical system, transmission, drivetrain and the engine as well as fuel and power steering systems. Unless dirt and other contaminants are completely removed from all of these vital components (which is not an easy, let alone cheap task), the car will suffer from increased wear and premature failure.<br />
AAA offers the following tips on how to recognize a flood-damaged car.<br />
<strong>Use your senses.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for signs of water damage, including water lines on headlights and elsewhere.</li>
<li>Do a thorough inspection by checking for mud, mildew or other residue under carpets, on the trunk floor and other enclosed areas like door panels and the gas tank, paying close attention to tiny hard-to-clean crevices.</li>
<li>Any unusual smells, such as dampness or mold, are red flags.</li>
<li>Turn on the engine to make sure it sounds as it should.</li>
<li>During a test drive, make sure the car &#8220;feels&#8221; right.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check under the dash.</strong><br />
Underneath the dashboard is a particularly hard area to clean. A dishonest seller looking to quickly flip the car will likely clean the rest of the car, but skip this part.<br />

<strong>Get the car&#8217;s vehicle history report.</strong><br />
Obtaining the car&#8217;s history via <a href="http://www.carfax.com/car_buying/" target="_blank">CARFAX</a> will reveal if it&#8217;s been in a major accident, such as a flood or fire. You can also check the VIN in the <a href="http://www.nicb.org/" target="_blank">National Insurance Crime Bureau</a> database of vehicles involved in recent hurricanes. This service is free-of-charge, but keep in mind it doesn’t cover all flood-damaged vehicles.<br />
<strong>Have it inspected.</strong><br />
Any car should be inspected by a quality repair facility before it&#8217;s purchased. There are plenty of mechanics out there who are trained in handling flood-damaged vehicles, so don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for a flood inspection.<br />
<strong>Use PaySAFE to avoid fraud.</strong><br />
Using PaySAFE to complete a transaction is also a great way to avoid fraud. Acting as a neutral third party escrow service, PaySAFE offers the buyer (and seller) safe, secure and easy-to-use tools to close the deal. The buyer and the seller exchange no money until all the terms of the transaction are approved.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s sad but true: Natural disasters bring about all types of scams, schemes and frauds designed to take advantage of people in need and those wanting to offer help. Whether it&#8217;s a high-pressure sales pitch from a <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/11/02/beware-fly-by-night-contractors-during-natural-disasters/">fly-by-night contractor</a> or a &#8220;charity&#8221; asking for a small contribution for relief efforts via a cold call, the types of scams are many and far reaching.<br />
To help you avoid being victimized, here&#8217;s a list of common frauds that surface in the midst of a natural disaster:<br />
<strong>Flooded cars</strong><br />
Right now in the U.S. there are hundreds of thousands of flood-damaged cars, many of which will wind up for sale on used car lots and elsewhere with no disclosure of their soaking-wet history. Avoid too-good-to-be-true offers and always have any car you&#8217;re looking to purchase inspected by a trusted mechanic. If a trusted mechanic is unavailable, hire a <a href="http://testdrivetech.net/paysafe/" target="_blank">professional inspection service</a>.<br />

<strong>Fly-by-night contractors</strong><br />
These scammers appear in communities right after a disaster occurs with the aim of profiting from the losses of their unsuspecting customers. They often do this by collecting up-front deposits from customers and moving on to the next town before the work is completed or, in some cases, even started.<br />

<strong>Insurance scams</strong><br />
Post-disaster, beware of insurance fraudsters who appear for the sole purpose of exploiting the devastation. Be sure to know the company you&#8217;re dealing with and ask for proof of an insurance license. If those first two items check out and you move forward with an insurance claim, fill out all paperwork thoroughly and honestly and be sure to get a hard copy of your policy.<br />
<strong>Phony investment opportunities</strong><br />
Scammers often go around after a disaster pitching to know stocks that will greatly benefit from cleanup operations. Avoid this situation by not investing in anything that will supposedly appreciate because of the disaster at hand. Also, delete any e-mails and social media posts that claim to offer investment opportunities.<br />
<strong>Phony charities</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re prone to give to charities, especially to help the relief efforts of a natural disaster, be sure to only donate to charities that you already trust and know are legitimate. Avoid giving any money to so-called charities asking for donations via cold calls, texts or tweets.<br />
<strong>Avoid fraud using PaySAFE</strong><br />
From titled vehicles to construction services, PaySAFE is an ideal way to buy or sell goods and services. As an online closing table, PaySAFE provides buyers and sellers a convenient one-stop location to create, negotiate and close trades with financial protection.<em><br />
