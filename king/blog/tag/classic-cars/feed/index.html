Some seek out only pick-ups or brand make-specific vehicles. Others look for long-term restoration projects and others want to add a modern twist to a classic style. Among the many groups of collectors there are also those that seek out matching number classic cars. <a title="Number Matching on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_matching" target="_blank">Matching number classic cars</a> vary from non-matching models in one very important way &#8211; all the serial numbers on specific parts match the numbers on the vehicles original number plate.<br />
<strong><em>Why would I want part numbers to match?</em></strong><br />
Manufacturers began placing serial numbers on major car components when vehicle ownership began to boom. This allowed manufacturers to track mass production over an increasingly larger number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines across the country. As these classic cars from the 50s and 60s have aged, many have had replacement parts installed when original components wore out or were destroyed. Because of that fact, finding a vehicle with all of its original, matching part numbers is becoming increasingly rare. To some, these matching number vehicles are the holy grail of the classic and collector car world.<br />
<strong><em>What&#8217;s a number plate?</em></strong><br />
Most every driver knows about a car&#8217;s vehicle identification number, or VIN. While the VIN is easily located on most vehicles, the number plate is different and can be a bit more challenging to find and will also vary when it comes number of serial numbers listed. Common serial numbers that are included on classic car number plates are the engine, transmission, and rear axle. Some vehicles will also include numbers for parts like the carburetor and alternator.<br />
<strong><em>Is there a bare minimum?</em></strong><br />
While the definition of a matching number car will vary a bit from collector to collector, a good rule of thumb when it comes to seeking out or advertising a vehicle as &#8216;matching number&#8217; is to ensure that the engine, transmission and rear axle numbers all are original to that car&#8217;s VIN. There may be more parts that match on your car, but most collectors seeking out a matching number car will expect that those three major components match.<br />
If you have trouble locating the number plate or any of the serial numbers on your own car or one that you&#8217;re looking to purchase, contact your local make-specific car club. These hobbyists and experts are pros when it comes to locating these numbers and can be a huge help in determining whether the vehicle in question is a true matching number car. You can <a title="Hemmings' Car Club Finder" href="http://www.hemmings.com/clubs/" target="_blank">find a local car club</a> through Hemmings&#8217; handy car club finder or by asking around at any local car show.<br />

While it can be task enough winterizing your home for strong, northerly winds and snow you also need to pay some close attention to how you prepare your classic cars for the winter season. Although we&#8217;re already in the heart of winter, there are still some great tips and any classic car owner should pay attention to &#8211; especially if this is your first time storing a classic car in the off-season.<br />
<em><strong>Take a Load Off</strong></em><br />
If you haven&#8217;t done this already, lifting your vehicle on jacks while in storage can help save tires from flat spots and suspensions from constant compression. Sitting in one position for four to five months would be dangerous for you, and can be equally risky for your car.<br />
<em><strong>Keep a Full Tank</strong></em><br />
Most of us will try to get as much as we can out of a tank of gas these days, but wrapping up your vintage ride for the winter on fumes isn&#8217;t smart. Make sure that you fill up your car completely before storage with as high of an octane fuel as is available. Higher octane fuels breakdown more slowly and will keep their chemical structure in tact more securely than lower octane fuels. You can help avoid the fuel breakdown almost completely by adding in a bottle of fuel stabilizer to the tank as well.<br />
<em><strong>Pull the Battery</strong></em><br />
Winter is hard on ALL car batteries, but it&#8217;s especially hard on batteries that are cycled regularly. To save yourself some hassle come spring time, remove the battery from your car before storage and consider storing it in a more temperate place &#8211; like your basement.<br />
<em><strong>Keep it Clean</strong></em><br />
If you didn&#8217;t give your baby a thorough cleaning before you put her away for the winter you had better get on it when the next nice day rolls around. A dirty vehicle will corrode much more quickly as compounds are allowed to slowly burrow their way in during the winter months. Make sure your car is spotless, and invest in a good quality, breathable car cover as well. This will allow any moisture that accumulates on the vehicle to evaporate away as opposed to being trapped under the cover and on top of your beautiful paint job.<br />
<em><strong>Rev It Up</strong></em><br />
When you&#8217;ve got 30 minutes or so to spare on a nicer winter day, stop by and let your car run for a bit. Few things are as dangerous for a car as inactivity, so make sure to stop by every 60 days or so and let it run for about 30 minutes. This will give any fluids a chance to get warmed up and circulated so that all the components stay in good working order.<br />
No matter where you may spend your winter months, make sure that any vehicle that you place into storage is left in as pristine a condition as possible. Not only will it ensure that your classic car stays in good condition, but winterizing properly will mean less time getting things running in the spring and more time on the road!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-car.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2116" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/old-car.jpg?w=300" alt="Picture of a Rusty Old Car" width="300" height="201" /></a>It&#8217;s often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that you can&#8217;t possibly put a price on love. But when it comes to buying and selling collector items like classic cars sentimental value is hardly the coin of the realm. If you&#8217;re placing an ad on a classified site, or looking to setup and online auction, whether you&#8217;re the buyer or seller it behooves you to have an idea of what a vehicle is worth. Because the condition of the vehicle has a much greater affect on price than rarity alone, a simple rating system for any cars condition has been widely adopted by most auction houses and collectors.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 1</em></strong><br />
These vehicles are in simply the best condition one could ask for. Rarely, if ever, are they driven outside of simply rolling onto the greenery of a concours show. Colors and materials are correct, possibly even original, throughout the vehicle, and every surface gleams like new. These vehicles are the best of the best of the best.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 2</em></strong><br />
Condition two vehicles are condition one vehicles that are a little past their prime. These cars and trucks can still easily win a local or regional show if entered, but owners probably drive condition two vehicles a little more than they should, but any flaws are still only visible upon very close inspection.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 3</em></strong><br />
&#8220;Good&#8221; is probably the best descriptor when you think of condition three vehicles. Cars and trucks in this category are likely driven frequently, have some easily visible flaws or dings, but possess a number of characteristics of condition two vehicles as well. Fading of paint jobs is common, and minor mechanical issues may be present and persistent with these types of classics.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 4</em></strong><br />
Here&#8217;s where things can start to get a little hairy. Condition four vehicles need some work nearly everywhere. Mechanical issues are instantly audible or visible, cosmetic problems are seen even by those with an untrained eye, and previous restoration work is visible. No major parts or pieces are missing, but these types of classics need some love and care to be brought back from some neglect.<br />
<strong><em>Condition 5</em></strong><br />
Complete overhaul. Parts are missing or have been incorrectly retrofitted, paint and other cosmetic pieces show evident wear and tear, and it&#8217;s a 50/50 shot as to whether or not these vehicles will turn over when you twist the key.<br />
<strong><em>Parts or Salvage</em></strong><br />
Just what it sounds like, these cars exist only so that others may feed off of their components. Generally, this category of vehicles is worth about 50% of those in the condition five group.<br />
Why does knowing your chosen car&#8217;s condition group matter? Using the example of a 1957 AC Ace 2-door Roaster, the top condition one pricing suggestion is estimated at $272,000. Moving down just to condition two means a drop in price to $223,000 &#8211; nearly a $50,000 difference. Take that same vehicle down to a condition four, and the price dips all the way to $109,000.<br />

Another year has come and gone for the highly anticipated Scottsdale Auto Auctions, and 2015 did not disappoint. While the numbers from last year&#8217;s events were amazing, all the data from this year&#8217;s auctions shows an increase in every category: more cars sold, higher sales amount for individual lots, and more money made cumulatively across all of the auctions.</p>

Unbeknownst to many, items like helicopters, private jets, luxury watches and jewelry, even entire estates are listed on sites like <a href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition.com</a> for those with money to spend, but who also understand the value of a dollar. But with so much at risk with such high dollar items, how can buyers and sellers truly protect themselves against scams?<br />
<strong><em>Use a Reputable Website</em></strong><br />
There are literally dozens of websites that bring together buyers and individual sellers or brokers, but not all of those sites are legitimate. Reputable luxury classified websites like JamesEdition will take the time to properly vet listings and members. When in doubt, contact customer service. If you never receive a response, or the email you receive in reply is filled with grammar errors and broken links you&#8217;ll likely want to look for another site.<br />
<strong><em>Communicate</em></strong><br />
The work really begins once you&#8217;ve locked in your seller or won your buyer&#8217;s bid. At that point, keeping an open line of communication with the other party can help to head off any potential issues. The vast majority of deals that fall through only do so because of simple misunderstandings that could&#8217;ve easily been ironed out with a phone call or a few additional lines for clarification in a purchase agreement.<br />
<em><strong>Inspection, Inspection, Inspection</strong></em><br />
With luxury items it&#8217;s more important than ever to have potential purchases inspected. Because of the high dollar amounts attached to items like yachts, helicopters, and jewelry there&#8217;s even more for fraudsters to gain through misrepresentation or financial fraud. Once you&#8217;ve won an auction or settled on a price with a potential buyer, the next logical step will be for the buyer to have the item inspected. Sellers shouldn&#8217;t be surprised or feel slighted that a buyer wants to get a second opinion as they would likely want that reassurance themselves. As long as the requirements aren&#8217;t exceptionally off-putting, this is simply the chance for the buyer&#8217;s inspector to confirm what they have already been told by the seller or dealer.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds</em></strong><br />
The most common question we receive during transactions is &#8220;How can I really trust the other party?&#8221; The simplest and clearest way to put a nervous buyer or seller at ease is through the use of escrow. <a title="Luxury Escrow through PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> platforms simply act as a neutral third party to hold and transmit funds between two unknown parties. Buyers are protected as all funds are held securely until there is proof that the item has shipped, or has arrived for a final once over. Sellers are protected because all purchase funds are verified in advance &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds or credit card chargebacks.<br />
When it comes right down to it, most buyers and sellers are better at recognizing potential fraud than they realize. If either party is difficult to contact, refusees to answer additional simple questions, or throws down unreasonable demands it may simply be time to walk away. And, as always, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />

In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

<strong><em>Check Your Fluids</em></strong><br />
While lubricants can be a life saver during the dry winter months, the summer heat can actually burn off those fluids more quickly than you think. Coolant, motor oil and windshield washer fluid are all easily checked, but antifreeze is the one item you really want to keep tabs on as the outside temperature rises. Modern cars will often have a reserve tank that&#8217;s easily accessible, but classics can be tricky if you&#8217;re not familiar with all the ins and outs. One key safety tip: <strong>never</strong> open a reservoir or radiator while the engine is still hot.<br />
<strong><em>Use UV Protection</em></strong><br />
Sunscreen is important anytime you&#8217;re spending long days in the sun, but UV protection for your car is just as vital! If you store your vehicle outside during warmer weather, invest in a quality, breathable cloth cover or even a car-port style awning. If you enjoy washing your car by hand, invest in a wax that also has a UV protectant blended in. Prolonged exposure to the sun will quickly fade and paint job &#8211; not to mention quickly spiking the interior temperature of the car. A cheap, $20 sun shade for your windshield can also help save hundreds of dollars in repairs for dried out can cracked dashboards due to excess sun exposure.<br />
<strong><em>Under Pressure</em></strong><br />
Check your tire pressure! Spring can be a tricky time with lots of ups and downs in temperatures, but the heat of summer roads combined with over or under-inflated tires can be dangerous. Not only do you take a hit in the gas mileage department, but the risk of blowout on road trips and a loss in traction from splashy or springy tires is also a concern. While modern cars will often have an internal tire pressure monitor, nothing replaces a reliable tire pressure gauge. For a few dollars and a few minutes you can save yourself from plenty of time and hassle down the road.<br />
Follow the above tips and you&#8217;re sure to have a fun-filled summer that&#8217;s interrupted minimally from any vehicle maintenance issues. And let&#8217;s face it, you didn&#8217;t invest that time and money into your classic to just stare at it longingly from your air-conditioned living room, did you? Get out and drive!</p>
