There are dozens of reasons for buyers to seek out a quality used car. The most obvious reason is that their current vehicle has simply been run into the ground and a replacement is needed, but new drivers in the family, secondary or &#8220;fun&#8221; vehicles, and trucks specifically for work are also all possibilities. With the versatility of buyers in mind, <a href="https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/car-dealer-scientific-guide-10-best-used-vehicles-181842236.html" target="_blank">Yahoo! Autos</a> has compiled a great list of some of the most reliable used cars on the market &#8211; not segmented simply by model year or popularity, but by overall durability and reliability. So, let&#8217;s take a look at what could be one of the last used cars you&#8217;ll ever need to buy.<br />
<strong><em>Lexus LX470/Toyota Land Cruiser</em></strong><br />
According to Yahoo! Autos, this sport utility vehicle is rock solid. Durable, heavy, and aging extremely well, this vehicle is sure to outlast even the most rough and tumble first-time driver and came out tops on the list.<br />
<strong><em>Ford E-Series</em></strong><br />
With an engine that has been placed into over 10 million total vehicles, the Ford E-Series minivan has become the workhouse for many American families. Ford engineers have made several interior redesigns over the years, but have taken an &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach with the mechanics of this series. It&#8217;s easy to see why the E-Series has become the best-selling full-sized van in the country.<br />
<strong><em>Chevy/GMC Full-Sized Trucks &amp; SUVs</em></strong><br />
GMC has always focused attention on only trucks and SUVs, and as a result have built some of the most reliable trucks and SUVs on the road. With the same vehicles being sold under the Chevy brand name, buyers and seller can be confident that their Silverados, Tahoes, and Suburbans will be on the road for years and years to come.<br />
<strong><em>Ford Full-Sized Trucks</em></strong><br />
Giving Chevy and GMC a run for their money the Ford F-150 has been the number one selling truck for over 30 years, and for good reason. The body-on-frame construction of the F-Series has made it one of the most durable, rear-wheel drive V-8 trucks on the road.<br />
<strong><em>Totoya Prius</em></strong><br />
Departing from the other listed models in a major way, the Toyota Prius has proven to be one of the best bangs for your buck when it comes to used sedans. With owners that tend to take great care of their vehicles and solid construction, most Prii that are traded in show very little mechanic wear. Avoiding battery issues that were somewhat common with the Accord and Civic hybrids, Prii also so very little wear and tear on their battery systems.<br />
Depending on your needs these durable cars and trucks will be able to power through nearly any trials you put them through. From regular city driving that may be better set to a Prius to heavy hauling that calls on the power and ruggedness of an F-150, these used cars, trucks and SUVs will go the distance for a much more reasonable cost than their brand new counter parts.<br />

New car smell. Clothes fresh out of the laundry. Never before lived-in homes. There&#8217;s a major rush that we get when something is fresh out of the package and hasn&#8217;t been touched since coming off the assembly line. And new things are great, but when it comes to big tickets items why would you pay new item prices when you could get equally good functionality at a lower cost from a slightly used item?<br />
<strong><em>Machinery &amp; Equipment</em></strong><br />
New machinery can be a huge expense for any business. Not only is the price tag higher, but businesses often need to go through the process of financing unless they happen to have large sums of cash on hand. So, why go through the hassle when used equipment can give you the functionality you need at a price point that won&#8217;t put you into the red? The secondary machinery market that businesses can access through sites like <a title="MachineTools.com" href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> or <a title="MachineBook.com" href="http://machinebook.com" target="_blank">MachineBook.com</a> is massive. Tens of millions of dollars change hands annually, and now that the global economy is starting an upswing, demand for quality used machinery and equipment is on the rise. This secondary market also gives businesses the chance to pad their own accounts by selling used machinery to free up capital for other types of expansion.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</em></strong><br />
We all need reliable transportation, but the cost of new vehicle ownership can sometimes be too much to handle. Sites like <a href="http://craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> and <a href="http://nationalvehicle.com" target="_blank">NationalVehicle.com</a> have listings for thousands of pre-owned cars, trucks, RVs and motorcycles that can get you the transportation you need at extremely affordable prices. If you tastes go to the extreme, <a href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition</a> has even compiled listings for pre-owned items like yachts, helicopters, Rolex watches and luxury cars.<br />
<strong><em>Buyer &#8211; and Seller &#8211; Beware</em></strong><br />
Ultimately, the items you can find on the sites listed above are great so long as you have a way to protect your finances during the transaction. Without the benefit of a financing company or dealership to package monthly payments, transactions for used items are usually a single lump sum payment. As these purchases often take place between two parties with little to no experience with one another &#8211; and are many time separated by a distance that requires involving a shipping company &#8211; <a title="PaySAFE Online Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> can be of great benefit to both the buyer and seller. Buyers are protected knowing that their purchase funds will be held securely with a neutral third party until there is proof that the item has been shipped, or has even arrived for their inspection at the final destination. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified in advance, eliminating the risk of fraudulent checks, insufficient funds or credit card charge backs.<br />
While these secondary markets can be amazing finds when it comes to saving time and money, it behooves any buyer or seller to learn the ropes before diving in head first. There are different requirements and practices for each marketplace, and taking the time to ask questions of customer service reps or seasoned users can be a huge help. More often than not there&#8217;s one old adage that can save even the most veteran online buyer or seller: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
