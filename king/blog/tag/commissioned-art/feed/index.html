In recent years, <a title="Commissioned Art is Back" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/01/04/commissioned-art-is-sexy/" target="_blank">commissioned art has made a comeback</a> in a major way due in large part to the internet. No longer are collectors and art enthusiasts limited by their access to only local artists, but collaboration across the country and even around the world happens frequently. But while communication and idea sharing has never been easier, there are still certain considerations any commissioner should take into account when taking on a commissioned art project.<br />
<strong><em>Is the Artist Willing?</em></strong><br />
It may seem a simple thing to question, but determining whether or not your desired artist takes on commissioned work is an important step. Each artist will have their own approach to commissioned pieces, if they undertake those types of projects at all.<br />
<strong><em>Can You Afford the Piece?</em></strong><br />
Again, planning a budget seems like a no brainer, but the more well known an artist is the more likely it is that even small projects will command a large price tag. If the piece you want to commission is in a certain style or medium you may be better off working with a lesser known artist who creates work in a similar style. Which brings us to our next consideration&#8230;<br />
<strong><em>Does the Artist&#8217;s Style Fit Your Commission Idea?</em></strong><br />
It&#8217;s rare to find an artist that spreads their talent across multiple styles or mediums, so while you may have a favorite artist it&#8217;s important to consider whether their style or expertise is a good fit for your idea. For example, it may not be the best idea to take a commission for a large watercolor mural to an artists who specializes in stone sculpture, or an impressionist reproduction concept to an artists who only creates ink and pencil sketches.<br />
<strong><em>Be Courteous</em></strong><br />
When first reaching out to artists realize that you may not be their number one priority. You may be a long time fan of their work, or even have communicated previously, but when commissioning work you now fall into a different category. If your project is time sensitive, be sure to allow adequate lead time to accommodate ideation, discussion of budget, work-in-progress updates and shipping/final delivery. Most importantly, realize that the artist is now taking time to build you into their schedule and likely has other personal or commissioned works in various stages of completion.<br />
<strong><em>Payment</em></strong><br />
Artists may have various requirements when it comes payment. For a simple and easy way to accommodate deposits, progress payments and clearing final balances, consider an online escrow company. Because the total commission price is deposited upfront, the artist can rest easy knowing that they won&#8217;t have difficulty in collecting payment. Buyers can also rest easy knowing that they don&#8217;t have to write a check for the entire project from the start. Online escrow companies like PaySAFE can also easily accommodate multiple payments. This can be very beneficial for commissioned projects that have long timelines and may require payments throughout the process.<br />
While commissioned projects often have deeply personal ties, planning and knowing your own budgetary limitations can help alleviate many common bumps in the road.

Some of the world&#8217;s greatest masterpieces like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel were <a title="Commissioned Art on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_(art)" target="_blank">commissioned art</a> projects. Even today, artwork is commissioned for a wide variety of reasons. Perhaps the greater portion of commissioned art is what is called work-for-hire in the language of intellectual property. This means that an artist is employed by an individual to create art for a specific purpose. The terms of that employment usually dictate that the employer owns all rights to the work created.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Artists need to get a clear understanding of what the client wants and expects and be upfront about you are able to do. Remember that producing a work of art on commission for another party is a relationship and the key to successfully working on commission is your ability to be flexible and communicate with whomever hires you.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A commission relationship only succeeds when you respond effectively to the other party&#8217;s concerns, requests, and needs. Checkout <a href="http://www.caku-art.com" target="_blank">this blog</a> which outlines some realistic terms and expectations when entering into a commissioned project. It&#8217;s also smart to use a neutral, third-party online escrow service like <a title="PaySAFEescrow.com" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal/welcome">paysafeescrow.com</a> to create a safe and secure contract that will please all parties. These types of platforms provide buyers and sellers  with a convenient one-stop location to create, negotiate and close trades with financial protection. Online escrow services also allow the artist and client to set a timeline, be clear about how the work will be picked up, shipped, and who is liable for damage.</div>
