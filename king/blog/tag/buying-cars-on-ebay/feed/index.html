Looking for a car or truck on auction sites like ebay is now one of the most common methods used by used car buyers. So, before you discount online listings in your next vehicle hunt, consider the three reasons below as to why more and more car buyers are moving online.<br />
<strong><em>Online Escrow Protection</em></strong><br />
The advent of online escrow services has made buying large ticket items online a much more secure process. <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies can now easily protect buyers by securing purchase funds in an escrow account until there&#8217;s proof that the vehicle has been shipped, or has arrived at its final destination. Buyers who use online escrow services can rest easy knowing that their funds will not be transmitted until they give the green light to do so &#8211; completely removing the need to share financial information with the second party, or send cashier checks hundreds of miles away with only the hope that the car will be shipped.<br />
<strong><em>Cast a Wide Net</em></strong><br />
The sheer number of vehicles listed on online classified sites and auction platforms is mind boggling. Even the largest used car lot in your area often has only a fraction of the vehicles listed on ebay at any given time. More choices means buyers have more options, and aren&#8217;t limited by simply what&#8217;s available at local dealerships.<br />
<strong><em>See The Total Purchase Price</em></strong><br />
With the exception of any potential shipping arrangements, the cost listed on online classified and auction sites is exactly the cost buyers can expect to pay. No hidden fees, unexpected taxes or financing fees &#8211; just the sticker price and nothing more. While buyers can always take extra steps like hiring a third party inspection company like WeGoLook.com, or specialized shipping through companies like uShip.com, online listed prices rarely include any surprise charges.<br />

But if you&#8217;re a buyer who ends up with a vehicle that you suspect to different than advertised, how can you tell for sure? Some of the tips below will provide simple tools to use and common items to check for basic types of vehicle fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Odometer Fraud</em></strong><br />
According to the Consumer Federation of America, nearly 1 in 10 Americans is driving around in a vehicle with an incorrect odometer. Both mechanical and digital odometers can be tampered with somewhat easily, but there are ways to protect against this type of deception. The simplest way is to compare the total mileage listed on the title to the odometer itself. Fraudsters will often attempt to make the title mileage difficult to read through blurring or smudging, but any items that are unclear or unreadable on a title should be a red flag to any potential buyer. You can also check mileage against any maintenance or oil change stickers that may be on the vehicle.<br />
<strong><em>Mechanical or Body Work Fraud</em></strong><br />
Another common type of fraud involves hiding mechanical or body damage. Most often this will include covering up minor things like scratches or surface rust while not disclosing that those items exist. More extreme cases of fraud can involve tampering with or altering mechanical components of the vehicle itself. The best fight against this type of fraud is to have any purchased vehicle properly inspected by a mechanic. Unless you happen to have extensive knowledge about the make or model you&#8217;re purchasing, only a professional will be able to spot the signs of tampering at the mechanical level.<br />
<strong><em>Washing a Title</em></strong><br />
This type of deception is most commonly found after major natural disasters like hurricanes or floods. With these types of disasters vehicles are sometimes given a salvage status due to heavy water damage. Washing the title refers to the practice of dealers or individuals transferring the vehicle to another state or region that doesn&#8217;t recognize that salvage brand. The easiest way to fight this type of fraud is to run a vehicle history report through a company like CarFAX. Companies like CarFAX run a comprehensive report that, more likely than not, will expose this salvage title that the seller may have attempted to hide.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Against Fraud</em></strong><br />
You can also head off any potential fraud at the pass by using an <a title="Car Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE. By placing your purchase funds with a neutral third party and crafting your own purchase agreement, you can have the chance to thoroughly inspect any vehicle you intend to buy before clearing the funds for release. Once you know that the vehicle you&#8217;re considering is what it&#8217;s supposed to be you can then release the funds to the seller, keeping your purchase money safe and sound.<br />
