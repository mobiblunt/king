								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Trust&#8221; and &#8220;integrity&#8221; are two words that should &#8212; but oftentimes don&#8217;t &#8212; go together when conducting a transaction that exchanges goods or services between two parties. By using PaySAFE, you can make sure those two words ALWAYS go together. As a neutral third party, PaySAFE provides trust you can build on, leading to better communication, timely delivery of goods/services and fewer disputes, all the while promoting the integrity of both buyer and seller.<br />
<strong>Trust</strong><br />
Acting as a trusted neutral third party, PaySAFE provides a clear, detailed snapshot of the transaction, which is accessible 24 hours a day through our easy-to-use project management dashboard. When utilized, these free online tools act as a management and communication system which provides transparency to both buyer and seller during the entire transaction. Trust is established between both parties because using PaySAFE ensures that no money exchanges hands until the details of the transaction are completed <em>and</em> approved by both parties.<br />
<strong>Integrity</strong><br />
Once buyer and seller agree to use PaySAFE for the transaction, the playing field is instantly leveled &#8212; no one has a supposed upper hand. This allows both parties to keep integrity throughout the entire transaction, as mutual agreement (and trust, which PaySAFE provides) is necessary to complete the transaction. As a do-it-yourself closing table, both parties are equally accountable for the transaction.<br />
<strong>The PaySAFE way</strong><br />
PaySAFE is an ideal way to buy and sell high-end goods, such as cars, boats and other motorized vehicles, as well as a safe and secure way to fund services provided by contractors, commissioned artists and more. By using PaySAFE, trust and integrity ALWAYS go hand in hand.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using PaySAFE&#8217;s online transaction management and communication system, funding a transaction is safe, secure and easy. After the initial <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/09/06/how-to-create-a-paysafe-transaction/">transaction is set up</a> and both buyer and seller agree that the terms of its completion have been met, funding the transaction is the next step.<br />
As you can see in the screenshot above, wiring money is PaySAFE&#8217;s preferred method, as it&#8217;s a fast and secure way of sending money with immediate availability. When the transaction is ready to be funded, you&#8217;ll be asked to click a link that will send you the required information to direct the wired money into your PaySAFE account. If you have any questions or concerns, customer service is available either <a href="http://mailto:support@paysafeescrow.com">by email</a> or by calling 402.881.7133.<br />
After funding is completed, you can use PaySAFE&#8217;s online tools to notify the seller that your payment has been received by PaySAFE and will only be released upon the satisfactory delivery of goods. No money will be exchanged if all the details of the transaction aren&#8217;t agreed upon by both parties.<br />
PaySAFE is an ideal way to buy and sell high-end goods, such as cars, boats and other motorized vehicles. PaySAFE provides trust you can build on, leading to better communication, timely delivery of goods and fewer disputes while promoting the integrity of both buyer and seller.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people selling high-end goods via places like Craigslist, eBay or even the classifieds section of a newspaper often fear the transaction process once an initial agreement with a buyer is made. At this point, many people ask questions like, &#8220;Can I trust this person?&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Should</em> I trust this person?&#8221; and &#8220;What if something goes wrong during the exchange?&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s situations like these where PaySAFE saves the day by acting as a neutral third party that offers the buyer and seller free and easy-to-use tools to close the deal with peace of mind. No money is exchanged until all the terms of the transaction are approved by the buyer and the seller. Read more about the <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com">benefits of using PaySAFE</a>.<br />
<strong>How to create a transaction</strong><br />
To create a transaction, both parties need to <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/signup">create an account</a>, which is free and easy to do. After this, login, select the New Transaction tab and fill out the details of the transaction. After calculating our minimal fee and by agreeing to PaySAFE&#8217;s <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/terms">terms of use</a>, the transaction is ready to go.<br />
<figure id="attachment_34" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/paysafetransaction1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-34" title="paysafetransaction" alt="" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/paysafetransaction1.jpg" width="460" height="461" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/paysafetransaction1.jpg 585w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/paysafetransaction1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/paysafetransaction1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34" class="wp-caption-text">An example of the first steps of creating a new transaction with PaySAFE</figcaption></figure></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">From here, the other party will be contacted via email to either accept or reject the transaction. Once accepted, the transaction is ready to be funded. Further details can be ironed out as well, like uploading attachments, such as bill of sale and other important documents. As the transaction unfolds, the buyer and seller can exchange messages on PaySAFE&#8217;s private communication board. And, as we mention above, both parties must agree when the transaction is complete &#8212; and until this point, no money will be exchanged. It&#8217;s the PaySAFE way of leveling the playing field for both buyers and sellers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2011, fourth-generation banker Matt Medlock founded PaySAFE with a vision to change how business is transacted and level the playing field for both sides of transactions. PaySAFE’s mission, as a neutral third party, is to provide Secured Audited Funding and Escrow (SAFE) accounts at the highest level of integrity and reliability to facilitate consumer trust and business transparency.<br />
<strong>How it Works</strong><br />
Through an easy-to-use online project management dashboard, PaySAFE provides both parties with a clear, detailed snapshot of each transaction. By including as much information as possible, including supporting documents and full descriptions of requested goods or services, both parties can assure transparency. And in the event of any disputes this information will be referenced.<br />
<strong>Why it Matters</strong><br />
Using PaySAFE leads to better communication, timely delivery of goods and fewer disputes while promoting both parties integrity.<br />
