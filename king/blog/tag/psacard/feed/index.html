								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh boy! This year the Baltimore Ravens go to battle against the San Francisco 49&#8217;ers and no matter what the final score there will be winners and some very sore losers. If the sight of that Jerry Rice autographed football makes you hate 2013,then sell sell sell! And if  your favorite team won, why then buy buy buy!<br />
If you sell your memorabilia to a dealer you will only get about half the market value, more or less depending on the popularity of the item, and the length of time the dealer thinks it would take to resell the item. You would want to sell to a collector to get the full market value. Auction houses are great place to sell valuable pieces of memorabilia. They will get you the most exposure to targeted collectors, and that will translate to a higher selling price. eBay is also a good venue for selling collectibles. You can do just as well but must be good at describing the item thoroughly, use good pictures to show the item. There are plenty of hard core collectors shopping on eBay spending big money.  If you are selling any autographs they will have to be properly authenticated, otherwise you could land up with half the market value. A good auction house will help you out with this, or you could <em>do it yourself</em> at <strong><a href="http://www.psacard.com/">psadna.com</a>.</strong><br />
Win or lose, buying or selling, make a safe and secure trade on sports memorabilia by using <strong><a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal/welcome">PaySAFE</a> </strong>an online closing table that allows two parties to trade merchandise with confidence and peace of mind. Their easy to use application creates and closes a transaction safe and secure by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a Purchase agreement</li>
<li>Uploading photos and supporting documents</li>
<li>Tracking communication</li>
<li>Utilizing Escrow service for Financial Security
<ul>
<li><strong>Buyers:</strong> Funds are only released once you have received your merchandice as agreed</li>
<li><strong>Sellers:</strong> Eliminate financial fraud and scams while securing the buyer&#8217;s funds upfront</li>
</ul>
</li>
