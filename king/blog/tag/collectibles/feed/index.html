Very subtle differences from one collectable to another can drastically alter the overall value of the item, and the market is frequently flooded with forged pieces &#8211; especially during the resurgence of teams or individuals. If sports memorabilia is your game, keeping an eye out for some of the common scams listed below can help you avoid becoming a victim of collectables fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Bloated Quality Rankings</em></strong><br />
Nearly all collectables are ranked on some sort of scale, be it 1 to 10, A through F, or any other combination. Some ranking authorities are always above board and lend an equally critical eye to each piece that collectors submit, but some rating agencies are softer than others. Depending on the type of collectables you&#8217;re shopping for, learn the rating agencies of repute and those that may hand out liberal top scores. Sadly, it&#8217;s not always a case of apples to apples.<br />
<strong><em>Trade Show Only Vendors</em></strong><br />
Memorabilia shows travel the country constantly. Most of the vendors at these shows are above board, but there are always sharks among the guppies. Some of these vendors are really collectors in disguise. In addition to their attempts to low ball any potential purchases, these vendors will often have no ties to the real world. So, if you are able to discern that you&#8217;ve purchased a fake item from one of these show vendors there&#8217;s no possible way for you to follow up or track them down. The best place for any serious collector to shop is a trusted and established brick and mortar collector&#8217;s storefront.<br />
<strong><em>Straight Up Fakes and Forgeries</em></strong><br />
These are the most common scams that any collectors will come across. Faked signatures, artificially aged baseballs and mitts, forged championship rings &#8211; there&#8217;s always a scammer looking to take advantage of rabid fans. The easiest way to protect again these types of scams are to have an established expert in your corner. If you don&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to learning all the ins and outs of what constitutes a forgery find someone who already has that knowledge at the ready.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Upfront</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re buying online through an auction or classifieds site, you should also be using online escrow. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller by holding funds as a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there&#8217;s proof that the item has shipped, or it has even arrived and you&#8217;ve had the chance verify it&#8217;s condition. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
While it&#8217;s impossible to know the mind and reputation of every buyer or seller on the web, keeping an eye out for the common scams listed above can help you head off any bad deals at the pass.<br />

Now comes the research and, most importantly, digging in to how much you should actually pay.<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5em;">A leader in value information,</span><a style="line-height:1.5em;" href="https://www.worthpoint.com/user2/createStep2?plan=unlimited">WorthPoint.com</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> is an online resource for researching and valuing antiques, art and collectibles. WorthPoint empowers the antique and collectible industry by providing a steady stream of new data and quality information &#8211; ultimately helping improve the transparency in pricing and value between sellers and buyers.  </span><br />
<span style="line-height:1.5em;">WorthPoint offers both a do-it-yourself (DIY) model as well as access to a knowledge network of professional appraisers with expertise in numerous collecting verticals.  Their do-it-yourself model is a simple solution that gives users access to over 130 million historical prices and images. This data is aggregated from both online marketplaces and from some of the leading auction houses. Setting the right value for an item is the crucial first step in a fair and amicable agreement. Once the price and terms of your transaction are set, we recommend using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> &#8211; like PaySAFE</span><sup style="line-height:1.5em;">®</sup><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> &#8211; to make doubly sure that your dream collectable doesn&#8217;t turn into a financial nightmare.</span><br />
With a collectable and antiques marketplace that is often fraught with reproductions and outright counterfeits, doing your own background work when it comes to pricing and valuation is a must. Whether you use WorthPoint or another trusted professional, be sure you know what you&#8217;re getting into before you get too deep.<br />

Here are some hints into successful collecting:</p>
<ol start="1">
<ul>
<li>Contact <a title="List of Auction Houses on Google" href="https://www.google.com/#q=auction+houses" target="_blank">auction houses</a>. Find auction houses on the Internet and contact as many as possible regarding both upcoming sales of sunken treasure coins as well as any information they may have regarding private parties willing to sell sunken treasure coins.</li>
<li>Do your own homework. Find out as much information as you can about the current value of any sunken treasure coins that you fancy. Concentrate your efforts on finding out how many of each coin is known to exist as well as when the last three similar coins sold and for how much.</li>
<li>Determine whether prices have been trending upward or downward on the coins you are interested in.</li>
<li>Do NOT be in a hurry to buy coins from the most recent treasure discovery. If a treasure has been recently discovered and there is a great deal of publicity about it, the price for coins from this find are likely to be highly inflated. Once the excitement has died down, so will the prices for the coins.</li>
<li>Ask for a provenance for any sunken treasure coin you buy to protect yourself from possible frauds and imitations. Buying from a reputable dealer or an auction house provides some protection as these entities want to protect their good names and will not knowingly sell a phony items.</li>
<li>Use an online escrow service and/or closing table, like <a title="PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com/personal/welcome" target="_blank">PaySAFEescrow.com</a>, to insure a safe and secure trade for both parties involved.</li>
</ul>

Populated of both people who consider themselves casual collectors all the way to obsessive fans, the market for collectibles sees millions of dollars exchange hands each year. And that&#8217;s just in the United States.<br />
As a collector, it&#8217;s of vital importance to know the actual value of what you&#8217;re buying. On top of this, when purchasing a collectible through an online auction website, such as eBay or <a href="http://www.worthpoint.com" target="_blank">WorthPoint</a>, you need to make sure it&#8217;s described accurately and is 100% authentic. This is often hard to do because you only see pictures of the item &#8211; unable to see and examine it in person, let alone authenticate with a professional.<br />
<em><strong>Finding the proper value<br />
</strong></em>Every collector should know the relative value of what they&#8217;re buying. Digging a little deeper and learning how and why things are priced as they are and exactly how conditions are graded will only add to your appreciation.<br />
Below are a few ways to ensure what you&#8217;re buying is priced correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check prices of similar items of similar conditions that have sold recently.</li>
<li>Seek out and ask for advice from members of online communities such as forums.</li>
<li>If the item is unique and/or you simply don&#8217;t trust your internet research, contact your local professional or call a national appraiser.</li>
<li>If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Authenticating<br />
</em></strong>There are plenty of professional authenticators available to make sure the collectible you&#8217;re buying is the real deal. The authentication process can seem like a daunting task, especially if you can&#8217;t find someone local you trust. Sure, it can take several days to weeks to complete the verification process, but it’s a necessary step and is much better than later finding out you&#8217;ve been ripped off. When authenticating coins, stamps, sports cards, memorabilia and other types of collectibles, we recommend using <a href="http://www.collectorsuniverse.com" target="_blank">Collectors Universe</a>.<br />
Also, it’s important to use PaySAFE as a DIY closing table the next time you purchase a valuable collectible.<br />
<strong><em>Trading safely<br />
</em></strong>As a buyer, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Escrow for Collectables" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/personal-escrow" target="_blank">online escrow</a> companies can hold your funds until the transaction is complete. Escrow services also give you the ability to authenticate the item before releasing any money. This ensures you’re buying exactly what&#8217;s advertised — protecting you from common frauds, like the seller swapping a certified-authentic item with a fake at shipping.</p>

And, like other markets where there&#8217;s money to be had, there are scammers lurking about claiming to sell authentic items that are actually fakes. Naturally, this is one of the major concerns a buyer has when making a purchase.<br />
Even reputable auction websites, <a href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2012/10/18/a-safe-way-to-buy-personal-goods-on-ebay-and-craigslist/">such as eBay</a>, can&#8217;t weed out 100% of fraudulent items for being sold as &#8220;authentic.&#8221; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to use PaySAFE&#8217;s online escrow service the next time you purchase a valuable collectible.<br />
As a buyer, PaySAFE not only holds your funds until the transaction is complete, it gives you the ability to authenticate the item before releasing any money. This ensures you&#8217;re buying exactly what you&#8217;re paying for &#8212; protecting you from common frauds, like, for example, the seller switching a certified 1952 Mickey Mantle rookie card with a fake at shipping.<br />
<strong>Authentication made easy</strong><br />
Authentication may seem like a daunting task &#8212; and yes it can take several days to weeks &#8212; but it&#8217;s a necessary step in verifying that what you&#8217;re buying is the real deal, as there are few feelings worse then the ones you experience when you know you&#8217;ve been ripped off.<br />
Luckily, there are several great resources out there to help authenticate and value collectibles such as trading cards, autographs, tickets and ticket stubs as well as gear worn and/or signed by professional athletes like bats, helmets, gloves and more. We recommend <a href="http://www.psacard.com/" target="_blank">Professional Sports Authenticator</a>.<br />
<strong>Trading safely</strong><br />
