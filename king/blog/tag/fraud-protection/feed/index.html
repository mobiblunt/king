In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

<strong><em>Change Your Passwords</em></strong><br />
Most businesses that allow internet access for their employees require that their employees reset their passwords every six months or so. While you don&#8217;t need to set a weekly calendar reminder, changing up your password occasionally &#8211; and especially if you believe any of your online accounts have been compromised &#8211; is a good rule of thumb. And speaking of passwords&#8230;<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Use Obvious Passwords</em></strong><br />
Surprisingly, many people still use passwords like &#8216;12345&#8217; or &#8216;password&#8217; for their online accounts. One of the best things you can do is pick a password that contains a mix of upper and lower-case letters, at least one number and one special symbol like an @ or &amp;. And if your password is one of these listed on the <a title="25 Worst Passwords of 2013" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2089244/the-25-worst-passwords-of-2013-password-gets-dethroned.html" target="_blank">Top 25 Worst Passwords of 2013</a>, you need to change things up soon!<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Save Credit/Debit Payment Info</em></strong><br />
Many online shopping sites will give you the option to save your credit or debit card information as you&#8217;re completing a purchase. While it&#8217;s extremely convenient to simply login and have your payment info ready to go, it&#8217;s just as easy for a scammer who has access to your account to do the same thing. Sure, it may take a few extra second to enter that card info each time you checkout, but choosing not to save your card numbers can save you hours of hassle should your online shopping account be compromised.<br />
<strong><em>Never Give Out Account Info Via Email</em></strong><br />
Scammer are smart. Many phishing scams sent through email are dressed up in the guise of a security breach and are designed to look remarkably similar to an official bank email. While it may be tempting, NEVER give out your bank or personal information via email. If you happen to receive an email that looks like it&#8217;s from your bank or credit card company asking for your account information, call the business personally and check it out. If it is a legitimate email, the customer service rep you speak with should be aware of the issue and can help you over the phone.<br />
<strong><em>Use 2-Phase Security Validation When Possible</em></strong><br />
This sounds more complex than it really is. Basically, when someone attempts to log in to one of your accounts from an unfamiliar computer they&#8217;re then prompted to enter a security code that is usually sent via text or phone call to your cell phone. They must then enter that code before they can proceed any further into the login process. This type of security is beneficial in two ways. First, it alerts you that someone is attempting to log in to one of your accounts should you receive that text or phone call. Secondly, it presents a difficult hurdle for scammers to attempt to bypass. In addition to the tips above, anytime you plan to make a large purchase you should definitely consider an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a>. These types of services help ensure that your funds are safely transferred from buyer to seller while keeping all of your personal information private.</p>
