								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/combine.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2123" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/combine.jpg?w=300" alt="combine" width="300" height="146" /></a>Because heavy equipment is the lifeblood of any farm or ranch, buying used can yield tractors and combines that are in near new condition. Most tractor and combine owners keep their equipment in as good of condition as possible, so the secondary market is an excellent stop for anyone looking for a new addition to their work shed. While most farming implements can be simple to inspect on your own, tractors and combines specifically can be a bit more tricky. To ensure that you don&#8217;t get stuck with any hidden problems in your next buying opportunity, we&#8217;ve line up some key points of inspection that should never be ignored.<br />
<strong><em>Used Combines</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compare your the combine&#8217;s engine hours vs. separator hours. Significantly longer engine hours warrants a closer inspection of the drive train and transmission.</li>
<li>Look for signs of wear on larger belts, chains and sprockets. Excessive wear can indicate poor maintenance, or extremely hard use by the current owner.</li>
<li>Be sure to note excessive play in bearings or slots while inspecting the cleaning shoe and sieve assemblies. Did you notice any spot welds or breakage?</li>
<li>If at all possible, get the combine started and running for a bit to see if you notice and audible problems like grinding, screeching, or knocking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Used Tractors</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the frame. Has it ever been spring or repaired?</li>
<li>Inspect the hydraulic and oil lines. Leaks here are common and can be repaired somewhat easily, but problems should still be noted.</li>
<li>Gives the tires a good once over. Are they in good condition, or are they going to need replacing soon?</li>
<li>Does the cab have a ROPS (rollover protection structure), or a wide enough front-end to protect against rollovers?</li>
<li>Note any aftermarket additions that the current owner may have installed. If anything has been added, you may want to cross reference or consult with a dealer to see if those modifications can be supported.</li>
<li>Start it up and drive around the yard if it&#8217;s at all possible. You&#8217;ll get a greater sense of the transmission and drive train if you&#8217;re able to get behind the wheel. This is your chance to note any slippage or shifting issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Inspections</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re not able to inspect the equipment yourself, consider providing a list of must-see items to a third party inspection company like <a title="Inspections with WeGoLook.com" href="http://wegolook.com" target="_blank">WeGoLook</a>. It&#8217;s not uncommon for owners to have inspection documents or a mechanic&#8217;s history available to potential buyers, but a third party inspector can provide photos and video from a truly neutral position. The folks at WeGoLook.com can also create custom inspections to review any additional implements or accessories beyond the main equipment.<br />
The key to purchasing any previously owned equipment is to do your homework. Investing a little time and effort into research can save you hours of frustration and headaches that come with equipment that doesn&#8217;t meet work needs.

First and foremost, if you&#8217;re looking to add some new iron to your arsenal price is always a consideration. That being said, there are some other aspects you should definitely take into consideration when looking at used equipment at farm auctions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shop Around</em></strong><br />
According to Greg Peterson, Farm Journal Media&#8217;s used-equipment expert, <a title="Machinery Pete’s 5 Tips for Buying Used Equipment" href="http://www.agweb.com/article/machinery_petes_5_tips_for_buying_used_equipment_NAA_Sara_Schafer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farm auctions often have some of the highest prices on the market</a>. Because of that, it&#8217;s important to seek out and compare prices in other arenas &#8211; consignments, dealer and online auctions for example. As Peterson points out, saving 3-5% on machinery priced at $300,000 or more can be a significant savings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read the Fine Print</em></strong><br />
From a buyer&#8217;s perspective, be sure to pay close attention to the descriptions offered by the seller or auction house. If anything seems amiss don&#8217;t be afraid to call the seller or auction house and see if they&#8217;re able to fill in the blanks. Also be sure to find out what guarantees or warranties may be attached to the equipment or if it&#8217;s being sold in &#8216;as is&#8217; condition.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inspect the Goods</em></strong><br />
Inspections can be the key when it comes to buying any used equipment. As construction and agriculture equipment can really take a beating &#8211; especially if it isn&#8217;t well maintained &#8211; a thorough pre-inspection by a certified farm equipment mechanic can be the difference between a great buy and a lemon. While the vast majority of live farm equipment auctions will start-up and put the item into action before beginning bidding, it is not uncommon at all for items to be sold with no guarantees as to condition and operation. Ritchie Bros. has a great checklist of <a title="Inspection tips: what to inspect before buying a used farm tractor" href="https://www.rbauction.com/blog/inspection-tips-what-to-inspect-before-buying-a-used-farm-tractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what you should inspect with tractors</a> specifically.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn the Language</em></strong><br />
Auctions and auctioneers have a language all their own. Do you know the difference between an absolute auction and an American auction? How about absentee bids and proxy bids? Be sure to familiarize yourself with any unfamiliar terms and check out this <a title="Auction Terminology and Definitions" href="http://www.auctionguide.com/tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of auction terms and definitions</a> for a crash course in auction terminology.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maintain Your Equipment</em></strong><br />
This may seem like a no-brainer, but performing regular maintenance and keeping your machinery in good mechanical and aesthetic condition can greatly affect the resale value. While individual preferences will vary from buyer to buyer, well maintained and cared for machinery will always fetch a more pleasing price for the seller once it hits the auction block.</p>
<p><strong><em>Protect Your Investment</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re purchasing equipment outside of an auction setting, be sure you take steps to protect your investment &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re buying/selling with an unfamiliar second party or over long distances. In those instances, <a title="PaySAFE Escrow - Commercial &amp; Agriculture Equipment" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/commercial-escrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow services</a> can be a great protection for both the buyer and seller to guarantee both funds and delivery of the equipment.</p>
<p><a href="/equipment/how-paysafe-works-equipment/">With PaySAFE® Escrow&#8217;s simple step-by-step process</a>, buyers can rest assured that their purchase will arrive after having submitted payment. Sellers too can be confident that purchase funds are verified up front and held securely with a neutral third party – eliminating the risk of non-payment. Farm equipment transactions done online or via auction can be risky, and you want to have the confidence that the other party is legitimate. Buyers and sellers of farm equipment trust PaySAFE® Escrow to facilitate transactions in a process that makes the transfer of assets safe, secure and simple.</p>
