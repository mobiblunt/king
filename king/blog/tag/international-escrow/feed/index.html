Both of these are exciting opportunities that come with risks for both importers and exporters.</p>
<p><a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The International Trade Administration’s Trade Finance Guide</a> says that an escrow service is a cash-in-advance option available to exporters and importers that reduces the potential risk of fraud. An escrow service acts as a trusted third party that collects, holds and disburses funds according to agreed-upon instructions from the exporter and importer in the transaction. Formerly, companies were forced to use expensive and time-consuming letters of credit from a bank guaranteeing the importer’s payment.</p>
<p>Escrow services like PaySAFE® provide a simple and cost-effective workflow for completing the transaction quickly and protecting both parties:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The importer or the exporter completes an online contract outlining the terms of the sale, including purchase price and expectations for when funds will be released to the exporter.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The other party reviews the transaction terms and approves the escrow contract.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The importer sends the agreed-upon purchase amount to the escrow service.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After payment is verified, the exporter is instructed to ship the goods. Upon delivery, the importer has a predetermined amount of time to inspect and accept the goods in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once accepted, the funds are released by the escrow service to the exporter. The escrow fee can either be paid in full by one party or split evenly between the importer and the exporter.</p>
<p>The Trade Finance Guide also points out that any sale is considered a gift until payment is received. PaySAFE® requires the importer to pay into the escrow account with a wire transfer, guaranteed funds for the exporter’s protection. PaySAFE also distributes funds via a wire for speed and guarantee of funds.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the Trade Finance Guide, different payment types present different risks to exporters and importers, and, for a variety of reasons, not all of the identified methods of payment are available (or desirable) to both parties.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Trade Finance Guide illustrates payment methods as more or less secure for importers or exporters:</p>
<p><a href="http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="size-full wp-image-5844" src="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="198" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods.jpg 450w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/international-trade-payment-methods-200x88.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The Guide recommends escrow services for “transactions with importers who demand assurance that the goods will be sent in exchange for advance payment,” and states that “escrow in international trade is a service that allows both exporter and importer to protect a transaction by placing the funds in the hands of a trusted third party until a specified set of conditions are met.”</p>
<p>Given the risk inherent in new trade relationships, escrow services can offer a mutually-beneficial, cash-in-advance method for importers and exporters in a variety of circumstances. Trade partners in new relationships or relationships that have presented difficulty in the past benefit from credit enhancements; and small companies for which letters of credit are too costly and time-consuming to complete benefit from a simplified and cost-effective workflow. Escrow is a tool that protects all parties and encourages international trade.</p>

Be it quicker customer response times, shorter closing timelines, or overall cost savings, businesses are constantly using various tools to tweak a little bit here and there in efforts to nudge the needle just a bit higher. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> is one such tool at the disposal of any business buying and selling high dollar items &#8211; and can be especially valuable to businesses with international partners.<br />
<strong><em>Simple Workflow</em></strong><br />
Escrow companies like PaySAFE can provide a simple, easy-to-use workflow for creating and managing transactions. From the simple items like the buyer&#8217;s and seller&#8217;s names and total transaction amount to complex purchase agreements and heavy documentation, a simple workflow and history can save time and money while minimizing any potential misunderstandings. Online escrow services also do an excellent job of prompting either party when there are items that require their attention, like the approval of purchase agreements, uploading of required documentation, or approvals for the release of funds.<br />
<em><strong>Lock In Sales</strong></em><br />
Online escrow can be a great way to separate window shoppers from serious buyers. As all purchase funds are verified and held up front, sellers can rest easily knowing that the total transaction amount is held securely, and is simply awaiting the completion of their agreement. Buyers can also rest easy as funds aren&#8217;t released without their approval. This could be at the time of shipment, after arrival, or at various checkpoints throughout the process.<br />
<strong><em>International Transactions</em></strong><br />
Buying and selling between two individuals or companies across the globe can be challenging. Escrow services like PaySAFE can help ease that tension much as they do with domestic transactions. With significant cost savings over more traditional payment methods &#8211; like Letters of Credit &#8211; escrow can provide all the security with none of the hassle. Often times escrow can be the most cost effective way to on-board new partnerships, or to transact with other businesses that may not have access to large lines of credit.<br />
<strong><em>Lightning Fast</em></strong><br />
There isn&#8217;t a business out there that isn&#8217;t looking for some sort of a competitive edge, and most often that edge relies on speed. Traditional payment methods like letters of credit can easily get bogged down with paperwork and compliance issues. Escrow works much more quickly, and can often go from funding to disbursement in the matter of only a few days. Compared to the weeks, or even months that can be attached to applying for lines of credit or constructing letters of credit, escrow offers a significant advantage for businesses looking for the ability to turn on a dime.<br />
