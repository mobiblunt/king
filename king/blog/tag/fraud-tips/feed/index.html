Congrats! Now comes the task of making sure it arrives safely from the seller, who just happens to live across the country. When you&#8217;re looking to ship any type of vehicle over a long distance there are a few items that you need to keep in mind to ensure your dream purchase doesn&#8217;t turn into a nightmare:<br />
<em><strong>1. Prepare</strong></em><br />
Any shipping company will want some basic information before they can give an estimate or schedule for pick-up. Items like the exact weight and dimensions of your vehicle can greatly effect the requirements for the shipper. Oversized vehicles like SUVs or custom designs can also incur extra fees, so be sure to ask additional questions if your dream car goes beyond traditional dimensions. Also be sure to thoroughly read through any paperwork &#8211; especially the <a title="Bill of Lading on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading" target="_blank">bill of lading</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s presented once the shipper arrives.<br />
<em><strong>2. Know Your Shipping Options</strong></em><br />
There&#8217;s definitely more than one way to ship a car. Some of the most common types of shipping vessels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enclosed or open containers</li>
<li>Multi-car trailer trucks or a pick-up, often called a hotshot</li>
<li>Non-stacking trailers</li>
<li>Multi-level carriers (you see these commonly at dealerships)</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of shipping options you choose will likely vary depending on the type of vehicle you&#8217;re shipping. You may also want to look around for shippers who specialize in a specific type of vehicle as well, such as classic cars or off-road vehicles.<br />
<em><strong>3. Know Your Shipper</strong></em><br />
Do some ground work and background research on any person or company that offers to ship your vehicle. It never hurts to ask about items like insurance, certifications and/or if the person your speaking with is a broker or the actual shipper. Much like researching a contractor or plumber, car shippers can vary from business to business.<br />
Above all else, never feel silly for asking questions. If you&#8217;re uncertain about any items that the shipper addressed, or not addressed, be sure to ask. And, as always, remember that if something seems too good to be true, it likely is.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, the Better Business Bureau publishes a <a href="https://www.bbb.org/vancouver-island/news-centre/news-releases/2017/02/top-10-scams-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Scams of the year list</a> to drive awareness of the variety of methods in which scammers take advantage of consumers. The BBB top 10 scam list includes the most reported scams of the prior year, providing consumers with tips. Click the BBB infographic below to learn more.</p>
<p>Here, in brief, are tips to protect yourself from falling victim to the BBB&#8217;s top ten scams:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hoax News</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t believe everything you read.</li>
<li><strong>Online Loans</strong> &#8211; Research any lender with the BBB to ensure they are reputable.</li>
<li><strong>Bogus Customs &amp; Delivery Charges</strong> &#8211; Keep track of packages you send and are sent.</li>
<li><strong>Fake Apps</strong> &#8211; Research apps before downloading them from your phone&#8217;s app store. Never click an unsolicited email or texted link to download an app.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Subscriptions</strong> &#8211; Read the fine print on trial offers. Do not provide payment information without first understanding the contract into which you&#8217;re entering.</li>
<li><strong>Phishing Imposters</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t open emails or click links that are texted to you by an unknown party.</li>
<li><strong>Lottery &amp; Prize Winner Scams</strong> &#8211; Never wire money or provide your credit card information to claim a prize. Legitimate lotteries do not require winners to pay fees.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party Application Services</strong> &#8211; Do not provide your personal information to an application completion service without first ensuring their legitimacy.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Support Scams</strong> &#8211; Never trust unsolicited contact from scammers pretending to represent your computer manufacturer.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Money Transfers</strong> &#8211; Never wire money or share credit card or banking information with strangers.</li>
</ol>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1396" alt="cyber monday post" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cyber-monday-post.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="202" srcset="https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cyber-monday-post.jpg 676w, https://www.paysafeescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cyber-monday-post-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As Black Friday approaches and we officially kickoff the holiday season, many will crash the gates of retailers in the wee hours of the morning to ensure a chance at some of the best retail pricing of the year. But after that dust has settled and the throngs of shoppers return home to reheat some Thanksgiving leftovers, another enormous shopping day is only hours away: Cyber Monday.<br />
For those who prefer to avoid crowds or simply enjoy shopping using nothing but a couch and laptop, Cyber Monday holds all the allure of Black Friday sans the chaos. As online retailers have become savvy to the annual boost in traffic each Monday that follows the Thanksgiving holiday, so have online scammers. To ensure that your holiday treats don&#8217;t become sour grapes we&#8217;ve rounded up some of the top safety tips from various organizations. So if you&#8217;re a cyber shopper, make sure you&#8217;re cyber safe.<br />
<em><strong>Avoid Pop-Ups</strong></em><br />
According to <a title="The Center for Internet Security" href="http://www.cisecurity.org/" target="_blank">The Center for Internet Security</a> (CIS), you should definitely avoid pop-up ads. While these types of ads are generally a simple annoyance, this time of year hackers frequently use this method to catch those shoppers in a frenzy for a great deal. If a pop-up does intrigue you, be sure to at least take a moment to scrutinize the offer and destination URL carefully.<br />
<em><strong>Update Your Software</strong></em><br />
CIS also highly recommends ensuring that your software is up-to-date. Whether or not you use a specific anti-virus platform, security updates often include items that close security loopholes and backdoors that were accidently left open when the software hit the market. Pausing to do any updates prior to a big online shopping spree is definitely a smart move.<br />
<em><strong>Update or Create Strong Passwords</strong></em><br />
Simple passwords are one of the biggest security risks you can have as an online shopper. Some of the most secure passwords are at least ten characters long and contain both upper and lowercase letters, numbers and at least one special symbol like an @ or &amp;. Making sure to use a strong password is especially important for and site that gives access to personal or financial information.<br />
<strong><em>Shop from Secure Sites</em></strong><br />
Take note of whether or not the sites you&#8217;re shopping on bare <a title="eTRUST" href="http://www.etrust.org/" target="_blank">eTRUST</a>, SSL or <a title="Better Business Bureau" href="http://bbb.org" target="_blank">Better Business Bureau</a> emblems. These types of certifications most often signify that the website has protections in place to secure their shopper&#8217;s personal information. While these insignias can be faked, they&#8217;re a great place to start when it comes to judging a new websites legitimacy.<br />
<em><strong>Check Privacy Settings and Bank Statements Frequently</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re shopping from a mobile device, be sure to review your device&#8217;s privacy settings. Broadcasting to the world that your entire family is out of the house and buying big ticket items is probably not the best idea. You should also review your bank and credit card statements on a regular basis. Unfortunately, signs of someone stealing your credit or debit card information may not show immediately, so be sure to review your statements regularly if you suspect something is amiss.<br />
<em><strong>Use an Escrow Service for Big Ticket Purchases</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re looking to make a purchase or two that is well outside of the norm when it comes to holiday gifts, consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> to ensure your payment doesn&#8217;t disappear into thin air. These types of online escrow services will hold your payment securely until your purchase arrives, removing the need to send a check and simply hope that your new classic car or ATV will arrive as promised.<br />
Whether you choose to brave the crowds on Black Friday or simply cruise the web on Cyber Monday, the tips above will help to ensure that your holiday purchases arrive safe and sound while your personal information stays locked away &#8211; snug as a bug in a rug. Happy Holidays!<a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cyber-monday-post.jpg">[polldaddy poll=7596162]</a></p>

Like any type of online transaction, there are pros and cons to private treaty cattle sales. Buyers and sellers alike would do well to brush up on the items listed below to make sure they aren&#8217;t taken by surprise.<br />
<em><strong>Pros:</strong></em><br />
From a seller&#8217;s perspective, private treaty sales give a great amount of control over how they marketing their livestock. There is more flexibility to promote the positive sides of the seller&#8217;s stock including the opportunity to highlight unique characteristics of their operation and facilities. Sellers are also able to negotiate the price directly with potential buyers without interference of third parties.<br />
Buyers can benefit from private treaty sales as they are given a more complete picture of how the animals are cared for; including the opportunity to discuss items like the overall herd health or nutrition information. This also affords buyers the unique chance to speak directly with sellers and develop one-on-one business relationships that go much deeper than a simple auction house. Private treaty cattle sales also allow buyers to purchase direct from a farm &#8211; reducing any risk of added stress or exposure to disease.<br />
<em><strong>Cons:</strong></em><br />
The same items that a positives about private treaty cattle sales are also some of the potential pitfalls. For example, sellers must be prepared to answer far more questions about their livestock than when selling through a third party. Both the buyer and seller must also have a solid working knowledge of current market values.<br />
Private treaty sales can also be difficult to locate. Classified cattle websites like The <a title="The Cattle Range" href="http://www.cattlerange.com" target="_blank">Cattle Range</a> or <a title="Cattle Exchange" href="http://www.cattle-exchange.com" target="_blank">Cattle Exchange</a> are excellent places to begin researching the private treaty process and often provide helpful tips for those new to the market.<br />
Once cattle have been transported off the lot it can be very difficult to recover and potential financial loss. With private treaty sales, sellers assume nearly all of the financial risk once a price is negotiated, making it all the more important to use an <a title="PaySAFE Livestock Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> to guarantee safety and security of funds both parties.<br />
Legwork = Profitability<br />
As long as you&#8217;re willing to put in the time and effort, private treaty cattle sales can be an extremely advantageous. Buyers can get the most complete view of the animals they are purchasing and sellers get the chance to showcase all of the hard work they&#8217;ve put into raising superb stock.<br />

<li>Meet the seller in person and inspect the goods personally if at all possible. In the event that you&#8217;re unable to inspect the item yourself, be sure to request an inspection from a third party expert.</li>
<li>Never use Western Union or Moneygram to send payment prior to receiving the item. Use only traceable money transfer options.</li>
<li>If it is too good to be true&#8230;..it is a scam.</li>
<li>Never send money out of the country. There are scams that specifically target military personnel and their families that ask for such payments.</li>
<li>Always talk to someone via phone and write down the number. Most scams are done only via email and never give out phone numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there is no foolproof way to prevent fraud, awareness is the best defense so be sure to use a third party, online escrow service like <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud">PaySAFE<sup>®</sup></a> when making important  purchases. These types of platforms allow both the buyer and seller to negotiate unique agreement terms for each transaction, and then keep track of all communication during the escrow process. There are also various means of identity verification and document tracking that can be great lines of protection for both parties.<a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud"><br />

No matter how you choose to complete your next online purchase, be sure to do some legwork to ensure that the other party involved is who they say they are. And, as always, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is.</p>
