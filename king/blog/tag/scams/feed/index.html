Very subtle differences from one collectable to another can drastically alter the overall value of the item, and the market is frequently flooded with forged pieces &#8211; especially during the resurgence of teams or individuals. If sports memorabilia is your game, keeping an eye out for some of the common scams listed below can help you avoid becoming a victim of collectables fraud.<br />
<strong><em>Bloated Quality Rankings</em></strong><br />
Nearly all collectables are ranked on some sort of scale, be it 1 to 10, A through F, or any other combination. Some ranking authorities are always above board and lend an equally critical eye to each piece that collectors submit, but some rating agencies are softer than others. Depending on the type of collectables you&#8217;re shopping for, learn the rating agencies of repute and those that may hand out liberal top scores. Sadly, it&#8217;s not always a case of apples to apples.<br />
<strong><em>Trade Show Only Vendors</em></strong><br />
Memorabilia shows travel the country constantly. Most of the vendors at these shows are above board, but there are always sharks among the guppies. Some of these vendors are really collectors in disguise. In addition to their attempts to low ball any potential purchases, these vendors will often have no ties to the real world. So, if you are able to discern that you&#8217;ve purchased a fake item from one of these show vendors there&#8217;s no possible way for you to follow up or track them down. The best place for any serious collector to shop is a trusted and established brick and mortar collector&#8217;s storefront.<br />
<strong><em>Straight Up Fakes and Forgeries</em></strong><br />
These are the most common scams that any collectors will come across. Faked signatures, artificially aged baseballs and mitts, forged championship rings &#8211; there&#8217;s always a scammer looking to take advantage of rabid fans. The easiest way to protect again these types of scams are to have an established expert in your corner. If you don&#8217;t have the time to dedicate to learning all the ins and outs of what constitutes a forgery find someone who already has that knowledge at the ready.<br />
<strong><em>Protect Your Funds Upfront</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re buying online through an auction or classifieds site, you should also be using online escrow. <a title="Online Escrow with PaySAFE" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">Online escrow</a> companies work to the benefit of both the buyer and seller by holding funds as a neutral third party. Buyers are protected as funds are held until there&#8217;s proof that the item has shipped, or it has even arrived and you&#8217;ve had the chance verify it&#8217;s condition. Sellers are protected as well as all funds are verified and held upfront &#8211; completely removing the risk of non-payment, insufficient funds, fraudulent checks and credit card chargebacks.<br />
While it&#8217;s impossible to know the mind and reputation of every buyer or seller on the web, keeping an eye out for the common scams listed above can help you head off any bad deals at the pass.<br />

In 2011 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 10.8% of adults in the United States &#8211; 25.6 million people &#8211; were victims of fraud. That same study found that 40% of those fraud cases originated online or via email. So, with the web seemingly a quasi-haven for scammers, how can you guarantee that funds are secure and transferred safely when buying or selling a classic car?<br />
While hardly a new technology, escrow is a tried and true process to securely pass funds between two unknown parties, or a buyer and seller that are separated by large distances.<br />
“Almost everyone has heard of escrow at some point,” said PaySAFE Escrow president Matt Medlock. “But most people only think of using escrow with real estate purchases. It’s so much more versatile than that.”<br />
Medlock founded <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com/car-escrow" target="_blank">PaySAFE</a> with two key goals in mind: Protect and secure PaySAFE user funds when buying or selling, and providing a simple, online workflow that allows anyone to become a DIY escrow expert. The result is a simple, six step process that allows anyone to draft a purchase agreement, fund an escrow account, securely transfer funds to another party, and see a time-stamped communication history that documents the entire process from start to finish.<br />
“We created PaySAFE with the beginning internet user in mind,” Medlock said. “Both parties are updated via email as they move through the process and can see all actions taken by each user from the moment they create the transaction.”<br />
Using an <a href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> service like PaySAFE also completely removes the risk of fraud presented in the form of fake vehicle listings. Because all purchase funds are transferred into escrow prior to shipping, sellers are saved the risk of insufficient funds or non-payment. Buyers are also protected as their funds are held securely with a third party until there’s proof of shipment, or the vehicle actually arrives at its final destination.<br />
Both buyer and seller are also required to provide a form of government ID &#8211; a photo of either a current passport or driver’s license &#8211; that PaySAFE crosschecks against the origin and destination of all purchase funds.<br />
Because of the two-way protection that escrow offers, Medlock said that the percentage of buyer or seller fraud is reduced to zero.<br />
While there are still plenty of honest people out there, the risk of fraud and scams has become an ever present thought for many an online shopper. Medlock hopes that the escrow process that PaySAFE provides can help put those fears to rest for anyone buying and selling high-dollar items.<br />
“Fraud and scams, sadly, will always be around online; especially around high dollar and luxury items,” Medlock said. “My hope is that we can protect enough people through the use of escrow to make the prevalence of online scams just a small blip on the radar.”<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Buying a car sight unseen can be scary. Take these steps to avoid becoming a victim:</h5>
<p><strong>The “Price Too Good to Be True” Scam</strong><br />
In this scam, a prospective buyer sees an attractive-looking car (often a classic or exotic car) for a price well below market value. When the buyer contacts the seller, he or she is notified that the seller and the car is outside of the country and will arrange for shipment of the car upon receipt of payment, most often via wire transfer (such as Western Union) or bank-to-bank transfer (for very large payments). When the money is transferred and collected, the “seller” breaks contact and the buyer is out the money.</p>
<p><strong>The Overpayment Scam</strong><br />
A legitimate seller posts a car for sale. He or she is then contacted by a prospective “buyer” (really a scammer) who offers to send a cashier’s check immediately plus additional funds to cover shipment of the car overseas. When the check arrives, the seller is instructed to deposit it and wire the overage to the “shipper.” When this is done and the wire transfer picked up, the “buyer” breaks contact and the seller is left on the hook to their bank for the fraudulent check and the missing funds.</p>
<p><strong>Escrow Scams</strong><br />
Many consumers are rightfully wary of sending large amounts of money to someone they&#8217;ve never met. Scammer frequently recommend the use of fake “escrow” services that will hold funds involved in the transaction until both parties are satisfied that the transaction has been completed. In a typical scam, a legitimate buyer will be approached by a scammer selling a car (again, often an exotic or classic car priced, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>usually priced well below market value</em></span>). The scam seller will offer to ship the car and that there is no risk of fraud due to the “escrow” service (purportedly eBay, PayPal, or another service). Once the money is transferred, contact is broken (or sometimes additional funds are requested to cover “unforeseen” events). In any case, the legitimate buyer never receives a car and loses their money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud">PaySAF</a>E</strong> is an online closing table providing buyers and sellers a convenient one-stop location to create, negotiate and close trades with financial protection. <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud">PaySAFE</a> is well aware of the scammers out there and offers this advice to consumers:<br />
<strong>Know the car&#8217;s market value</strong><br />
Be suspicious of a vehicle priced significantly below market value<em id="__mceDel">. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is</span>.</em><br />
<strong>Obtain a vehicle history report</strong><br />
A vehicle history report can provide useful information, such as who holds the title to the car and whether the car has been in an accident reported to authorities. You&#8217;ll also find out whether the car was ever reported stolen, salvaged or damaged.<br />
<strong>Inspect the car</strong><br />
Schedule an inspection with a professional mechanic. An early inspection can help you identify problems. If the vehicle is out of your state use an independent, third-party, vehicle-inspection company service such as <a href="http://www.inspectmyride.com/">InspectMyRide.com</a>, <strong><a href="http://www.inspectmyride.com/vehicle-inspections/about-us">InspectMyRide</a></strong> provides added confidence for both seller and buyer by documenting the condition of the vehicle.<br />
<strong>Confirm contact information</strong><br />
Before you send payment, verify the seller&#8217;s street address and phone number- <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">an email address is not enough</span></em>. ZIP codes, area codes and addresses should match up. Be wary if the seller is located overseas.<br />
<strong>Use email wisely</strong><br />
Avoid sending sensitive personal or financial information (such as your social security number, credit card number or checking account number) to a seller via email. Remember that <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">email communications are not secure</span></em> and can be easily forwarded to others.<br />
<strong>Get a detailed receipt</strong><br />
Ask the seller for a receipt that states whether the vehicle is being sold with a warranty or &#8220;as is.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Get title to the vehicle</strong><br />
Make sure you know what&#8217;s required in your state to transfer title to the vehicle you&#8217;re buying. <strong><a href="http://www.dmv.org/">DMV.org</a></strong>  takes all the information found within state DMV sites and puts it in one convenient easy to understand site.</p>
