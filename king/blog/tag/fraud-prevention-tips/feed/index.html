								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png"><img id="i-1206" class=" wp-image alignright" src="http://paysafeescrow.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/question_mark-icon.png?w=487" alt="Image" width="204" height="204" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever purchased a home &#8211; or even looked into the process behind purchasing a home &#8211; you&#8217;ve probably seen the term &#8216;escrow&#8217; quite a bit. In the most basic layman&#8217;s terms, an escrow account is simply a bank account overseen by a neutral third party; usually associated with high-value purchases.</p>
<p>But <a title="Escrow account on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow_account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escrow accounts</a> aren&#8217;t unique to real estate. These types of accounts can be useful for anyone looking to maintain accountability between two parties in ANY high-value transaction.</p>
<p>For example, say you were looking to purchase a classic car or a boat for your family vacations. Once you&#8217;ve located the pre-owned vehicle you want, you now are stuck dealing with a relative stranger for a purchase north of $10,000. How do you hold the seller accountable and ensure that you don&#8217;t fall victim to an online scam?Â Often <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online escrow</a> accounts help to fill that gray area between a buyer and seller who are unknown to each other.</p>
<h5>How Escrow Works</h5>
<p>As a neutral third party, the escrow company works to keep honest people honest and ensure that both parties can complete the transaction with much greater confidence than a money order or personal check. The buyer can transfer in the funds for the purchase knowing that it will be held in trust until they give the green light. The seller knows that the funds are available as soon as they provide the vehicle or goods to the buyer. The escrow company also has the ability to release partial funds to help with things like transportation or repair costs prior to the buyer receiving their purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, escrow accounts have greater use than real estate transactions. Anytime there are buyers and sellers looking for an extra layer of security in their deals, online escrow accounts are a great place to start.<br />
Have you ever used an online escrow company outside of real estate purchases? What did you find beneficial or difficult?</p>

The last two months of each year we all take a step back and enjoy the time we have with friends and family. It&#8217;s also a time of year that involves the largest uptick in shopping for many families as we purchase tasty treats and gifts for Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas and numerous other occasions. Unfortunately, this time of year also sees a spike in the number of scams &#8211; both online and off &#8211; that can ruin anyone&#8217;s holiday. So, to keep your yuletide merry, follow some of the simple fraud prevention tips below.<br />
<a href="http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/11/24/how-to-avoid-holiday-travel-scams/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Flight/Travel Scams:</em></strong></a><br />
With family and friends strung across the country, most Americans will do at least a little bit of traveling this holiday season. Scammers know this as well, and will often send offer of &#8216;free airfare&#8217; via email, fax or snail mail. These letters will often bare logos with striking resemblances to legitimate airlines or travel sites, but are actually phishing schemes designed to steal your personal information and/or credit card numbers. Always be sure to call and validate a deal that seems too good to be true, and NEVER give out your personal or banking information via email.<br />
<em><strong>Online Shopping Scams:</strong></em><br />
Cyber Monday is arguably the largest day of online shopping in the world. As we take the the web for great deals, scammers take to the web as well. Be sure to shop only on websites that offer Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protection or that bare the verification of third-party organizations like the Better Business Bureau or TRUSTe. Using your credit card also provides a layer of protection as you can easily contest any suspicious charges.<br />
<em><strong>Charity Scams:</strong></em><br />
Sadly, in a season of giving there are those who would take advantage of our good nature for their own purposes. There are many &#8216;sound alike&#8217; charities that pop up around the holidays. Use of the words &#8216;salvation&#8217; or &#8216;cancer&#8217; don&#8217;t always mean that a charity is legitimate. Giving online can also have pitfalls. Simply because a website ends with a .org doesn&#8217;t mean that the organization is an actual 501c(3) charity. When in doubt, call your charity of choice directly or visit them in person to make your holiday donations.<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=door-to-door+holiday+scams" target="_blank"><em><strong>Door-to-Door Scams:</strong></em></a><br />
Despite the cold weather in most of the country, this time of year sees an increase in door-to-door scams as well. These scammers will often pose as the on the ground representatives of charitable organizations or even tradespeople. Don&#8217;t fall victim to high-pressure sales techniques or sob stories that they may present. Again, when in doubt, tell them you&#8217;ll call the company yourself or give in-person at the organization&#8217;s local office. Some states also require a peddler&#8217;s license when selling door-to-door. Be sure to know the rules in your state and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for identification or proof that individuals are actually working with the company or organization they claim to represent.<br />
While <a title="Holiday Season Scams on Forbes" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/10/credit-cards-gifts-charity-internet-personal-finance-holiday-scams_slide_11.html" target="_blank">holiday season scams</a> don&#8217;t tend to vary greatly in substance when compared to the rest of the calendar year, these types of risks do tend to increase during the holidays. However, keeping tabs on your local news and following the tips above can help to keep your holidays season free of bad tidings.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1252" src="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/reportingescams.jpg?w=300" alt="reportingescams" width="300" height="112" /></a>Purchasing items like vehicles and collectables on the internet can be a great way to save money, but there are a few considerations that keep in mind to help keep your money-saving venture from turning sour.<br />
<em><strong>1. Understand as Much as Possible About the Auction or Purchase Platform</strong></em><br />
Each online purchasing outlet can have slightly different rules. Some platforms require a time limit for each item up for sale while others have &#8220;buy now&#8221; functions that allow you to circumvent the clock. Others have no official bid system at all and allow you to communicate with the seller to negotiate your own agreement. Knowing the differences between platforms can help you save time, money and hassle.<br />
<em><strong>2. Never Give Out Detailed Personal Info</strong></em><br />
While it&#8217;s common to share information like a mailing address or phone number, you should never be asked to share items like a social security or bank account number. Any seller asking for this type of information should immediately raise a red flag.<br />
<em><strong>3. Do Your Background Work</strong></em><br />
Do a cursory internet search for the seller&#8217;s name and address. If you&#8217;ve exchanged telephone numbers, give their number a quick call to make sure it&#8217;s legit.<br />
<em><strong>4. Know What&#8217;s Included</strong></em><br />
Some internet purchases may include a warranty or guarantee; others may or may not include shipping costs in the purchase price. When dealing directly with a seller, be sure that these common contract items are ironed out before sending any type of payment.<br />
<em><strong>5. Keep Good Records</strong></em><br />
Be sure to keep copies of any written or email correspondence until you both agree that the contract has been fulfilled. It&#8217;s also helpful to use these records to refer back to should there be any confusion as to which party has agreed to complete various tasks.<br />
<em><strong>6. Be Cautious of International Transactions</strong></em><br />
Any seller who resides in another country should be treated with extra caution. Consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> company or other neutral third party to ensure an extra layer of protection.<br />
<em><strong>7. Know Your Good&#8217;s Fair Price</strong></em><br />
Prices for used goods can vary greatly from item to item, so be sure to consult a subject matter expert or reputable source to familiarize yourself with pricing. <a title="Kelley Blue Book" href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">Kelley Blue Book</a>Â and the <a title="American Gem Society" href="http://www.americangemsociety.org/jewelry-appraisal-questions" target="_blank">American Gem Society</a> are examples of two entities that can help with pricing information.<br />
<em><strong>8. If it Seems Too Good to be True, it Probably is</strong></em><br />
This seems like a simple adage that your grandparents would repeat over and over, but it should raise an eyebrow when you see goods dramatically underpriced or in quantities that seem unreal.<br />
<em><strong>9. Report Anything Suspicious Immediately</strong></em><br />
<a title="The Internet Crime Complaint Center" href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> should be the first stop for anyone who believes they may be a victim of online fraud and is a partnership organization of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center.</p>

Mobile and online banking are incredibly convenient. With busy schedules and less time to actually go to your local bank or credit union to deposit checks, get cash, or adjust investments, mobile and online banking can be major time savers. However, just as with the advent of e-commerce, banking via wifi or cell signals from your phone or laptop has opened up new avenues of exposure for your financial and personal information.<br />
<strong><em>Don&#8217;t Stray From Home</em></strong><br />
If you&#8217;re a regular user of online banking to manage your credit cards and bank accounts, be wary of using computers you don&#8217;t normally use. While you may have an incredibly secure network of your own, the same can&#8217;t always be said about your friend&#8217;s desktop or laptop. All it takes is one quick balance check on an unfamiliar computer to unintentionally exposure your login and password to malicious spyware. Unless you&#8217;re sure about the security of another network, you&#8217;re better off waiting until you can login from home.<br />
<strong><em>Pick Complex Passwords</em></strong><br />
We&#8217;ve mentioned this security check before, but it&#8217;s imperative that you <a title="5 Simple Ways to Protect Your Privacy Online" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/11/5-simple-ways-to-protect-your-privacy-online/" target="_blank">choose a password that is more complex</a> than &#8216;12345.&#8217; The best passwords contain a mix of upper and lower-case letters, at least two numbers and a unique character like an &amp; or %. It&#8217;s also important to separate your passwords out by platform, i.e. a different root word for your Facebook login as compared to your online banking login. If one of your accounts happens to be compromised, this helps ensure that hackers aren&#8217;t able to easily access ALL of your personal and financial info from a single password. If you&#8217;re really stumped on creating tough passwords, check out this helpful post on with <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2011/11/08/8-ways-to-create-stronger-passwords" target="_blank">8 ways to create stronger passwords</a>.<br />
<em><strong>Use Secure, Updated Browsers</strong></em><br />
Not all web browsers are created equal. Be sure that you&#8217;re using a browser that is up-to-date as this ensures that any known security loopholes are closed. You should also use a browser that forces https connections whenever possible. Https connections verify that there is a more secure connection being made between your computer or mobile phone and the banking system on the other end. While this doesn&#8217;t guarantee 100% safety it&#8217;s a great place to start when determining whether or not the network is potentially compromised.<br />
<strong><em>Double Down on Password Protection</em></strong><br />
We&#8217;ve already mentioned how important passwords are when logging in to your mobile or online banking site itself, but what about your laptop or phone? Do you have a lock screen that kicks in when you haven&#8217;t used the device for specified amount of time? This is one of the simplest forms of protection as it makes it difficult for thieves to even access your device, let alone your banking website.<br />
Sadly, no matter how thorough you might be when it comes to password complexity or security of your home wifi network, nobody is completely immune from the possibility of financial information theft. If you believe that you have been a victim of financial or personal information theft, be sure to contact <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> in addition to your credit card and financial institutions.<br />

But after that dust has settled and the throngs of shoppers return home to reheat some Thanksgiving leftovers, another enormous shopping day is only hours away: Cyber Monday.<br />
For those who prefer to avoid crowds or simply enjoy shopping using nothing but a couch and laptop, Cyber Monday holds all the allure of Black Friday sans the chaos. As online retailers have become savvy to the annual boost in traffic each Monday that follows the Thanksgiving holiday, so have online scammers. To ensure that your holiday treats don&#8217;t become sour grapes we&#8217;ve rounded up some of the top safety tips from various organizations. So if you&#8217;re a cyber shopper, make sure you&#8217;re cyber safe.<br />
<em><strong>Avoid Pop-Ups</strong></em><br />
According to <a title="The Center for Internet Security" href="http://www.cisecurity.org/" target="_blank">The Center for Internet Security</a> (CIS), you should definitely avoid pop-up ads. While these types of ads are generally a simple annoyance, this time of year hackers frequently use this method to catch those shoppers in a frenzy for a great deal. If a pop-up does intrigue you, be sure to at least take a moment to scrutinize the offer and destination URL carefully.<br />
<em><strong>Update Your Software</strong></em><br />
CIS also highly recommends ensuring that your software is up-to-date. Whether or not you use a specific anti-virus platform, security updates often include items that close security loopholes and backdoors that were accidently left open when the software hit the market. Pausing to do any updates prior to a big online shopping spree is definitely a smart move.<br />
<em><strong>Update or Create Strong Passwords</strong></em><br />
Simple passwords are one of the biggest security risks you can have as an online shopper. Some of the most secure passwords are at least ten characters long and contain both upper and lowercase letters, numbers and at least one special symbol like an @ or &amp;. Making sure to use a strong password is especially important for and site that gives access to personal or financial information.<br />
<strong><em>Shop from Secure Sites</em></strong><br />
Take note of whether or not the sites you&#8217;re shopping on bare <a title="eTRUST" href="http://www.etrust.org/" target="_blank">eTRUST</a>, SSL or <a title="Better Business Bureau" href="http://bbb.org" target="_blank">Better Business Bureau</a> emblems. These types of certifications most often signify that the website has protections in place to secure their shopper&#8217;s personal information. While these insignias can be faked, they&#8217;re a great place to start when it comes to judging a new websites legitimacy.<br />
<em><strong>Check Privacy Settings and Bank Statements Frequently</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re shopping from a mobile device, be sure to review your device&#8217;s privacy settings. Broadcasting to the world that your entire family is out of theÂ house and buying big ticket items is probably not the best idea. You should also review your bank and credit card statements on a regular basis. Unfortunately, signs of someone stealing your credit or debit card information may not show immediately, so be sure to review your statements regularly if you suspect something is amiss.<br />
<em><strong>Use an Escrow Service for Big Ticket Purchases</strong></em><br />
If you&#8217;re looking to make a purchase or two that is well outside of the norm when it comes to holiday gifts, consider using an <a title="PaySAFE Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow service</a> to ensure your payment doesn&#8217;t disappear into thin air. These types of online escrow services will hold your payment securely until your purchase arrives, removing the need to send a check and simply hope that your new classic car or ATV will arrive as promised.<br />
Whether you choose to brave the crowds on Black Friday or simply cruise the web on Cyber Monday, the tips above will help to ensure that your holiday purchases arrive safe and sound while your personal information stays locked away &#8211; snug as a bug in a rug. Happy Holidays!<a href="http://paysafeescrow.precisionpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cyber-monday-post.jpg">[polldaddy poll=7596162]</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet has enabled con artists to deceive more people than ever before. <a href="http://backgroundcheck.org/">BackgroundCheck.org</a>Â published these statistics related to internet scams and fraud:</p>
<div>1. From 2005 to 2009, internet scam complaints rose from 100,000 per year to nearly 300,000 per year.<br />
2. The monetary loss of scam complaints easily exceeds $300 million per year.</div>
<div>3. Top 5 internet scams with the most complaints:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>4.4% &#8211; Identity theft</li>
<li>13.2% &#8211; FBI-related scams</li>
<li>9.8% &#8211; Miscellaneous fraud</li>
<li>9.1% &#8211; Advance fee fraud</li>
<li>8.6% &#8211; Spam</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Men report 25% higher monetary losses related to internet spam than women.<br />
5. In 2010, individuals in the 60 years or older group reported higher amounts of monetary loss from internet scams than any other group.<br />
6. The 3 most commons locations for internet scams to originate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>65.9% &#8211; United States</li>
<li>10.4% &#8211; United Kingdom</li>
<li>3.1% &#8211; China</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams">Craigslist</a> is a great resource for finding a purchase and a great place to get scammed. Â Here&#8217;s some advice from them to avoid fraud:</div>
<ul>
<li>Meet the seller in person and inspect the goods personally if at all possible. In the event that you&#8217;re unable to inspect the item yourself, be sure to request an inspection from a third party expert.</li>
<li>Never use Western Union or Moneygram to send payment prior to receiving the item. Use only traceable money transfer options.</li>
<li>If it is too good to be true&#8230;..it is a scam.</li>
<li>Never send money out of the country. There are scams that specifically target military personnel and their families that ask for such payments.</li>
<li>Always talk to someone via phone and write down the number. Most scams are done only via email and never give out phone numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there is no foolproof way to prevent fraud, awareness is the best defense so be sure to use a third party, online escrow service likeÂ <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud">PaySAFE<sup>Â®</sup></a>Â when making important Â purchases. These types of platforms allow both the buyer and seller to negotiate unique agreement terms for each transaction, and then keep track of all communication during the escrow process. There are also various means of identity verification and document tracking that can be great lines of protection for both parties.<a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/escrow-fraud"><br />
</a><br />
No matter how you choose to complete your next online purchase, be sure to do some legwork to ensure that the other party involved is who they say they are. And, as always, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is.</p>
