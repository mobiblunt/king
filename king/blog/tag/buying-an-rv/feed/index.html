And just as savvy buyers can save a boatload when purchasing a used car, smart outdoorsmen and women can save a great deal by purchasing a used RV. However, there are always a few important considerations you should examine before <a title="Buying a Car on Craigslist" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/06/10/buying-a-car-on-craigslist/">purchasing a used vehicle</a> &#8211; especially one designed to be used in the not-so-forgiving great outdoors.<br />
<strong><em>Know Your Needs</em></strong><br />
There area several classes of RVs. From simple fifth wheel trailers that can be towed behind mid-sized vehicles to tour bus-sized luxury cruisers that contain any amenity you can conceive of. If you&#8217;re looking for somewhere to simply stash your gear while you do some rock climbing your needs will be very different compared to someone looking to take a cross country trip with a family of six. Planning for your needs can help you avoid getting too little &#8211; or too much &#8211; RV.<br />
<strong><em>Prepare for Maintenance</em></strong><br />
RVs have all the maintenance and upkeep associated with both a home and a vehicle. As a result, it&#8217;s important to take regular maintenance into account when you&#8217;re looking at the RVs condition. How extensive is the plumbing? Is the electrical a plug-in 120V line or is it run by a generator? Because it takes the hardest beating, how well maintained is the roof? All of these things need to be considered when putting together an offer for any used RV you might find. It&#8217;s also extremely important to find out if your RV comes with any warranties or service guarantees. Those types of agreements can be real life savers in the event of an unexpected breakdown soon after your purchase.<br />
<strong><em>Test it All Out</em></strong><br />
Like we mentioned before, RVs have amenities and functionality of both a home and a vehicle. Because there are so many different items included, you&#8217;ll need to really take your time and go through any potential purchase with a fine toothed comb. Does the shower work? Does the flooring need to be replaced? Are all the weatherproof seals in good condition? Pay particular attention to the roof of any RV as most are nearly flat. This will be one of the first places to develop leaks that can lead to hidden water damage throughout the entire vehicle.<br />
As we&#8217;ve recommended in previous posts, your best bet will be to ensure that any potential purchase is <a title="Why Get a Vehicle Inspection?" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2014/02/24/why-get-a-vehicle-inspection/">inspected by a professional</a>. In lieu of an RV professional, you&#8217;re best is to bring in a seasoned RV owner who can help guide you through and inspection or bidding process &#8211; especially if this your first RV purchase.</p>

New car smell. Clothes fresh out of the laundry. Never before lived-in homes. There&#8217;s a major rush that we get when something is fresh out of the package and hasn&#8217;t been touched since coming off the assembly line. And new things are great, but when it comes to big tickets items why would you pay new item prices when you could get equally good functionality at a lower cost from a slightly used item?<br />
<strong><em>Machinery &amp; Equipment</em></strong><br />
New machinery can be a huge expense for any business. Not only is the price tag higher, but businesses often need to go through the process of financing unless they happen to have large sums of cash on hand. So, why go through the hassle when used equipment can give you the functionality you need at a price point that won&#8217;t put you into the red? The secondary machinery market that businesses can access through sites like <a title="MachineTools.com" href="http://machinetools.com" target="_blank">MachineTools.com</a> or <a title="MachineBook.com" href="http://machinebook.com" target="_blank">MachineBook.com</a> is massive. Tens of millions of dollars change hands annually, and now that the global economy is starting an upswing, demand for quality used machinery and equipment is on the rise. This secondary market also gives businesses the chance to pad their own accounts by selling used machinery to free up capital for other types of expansion.<br />
<strong><em>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</em></strong><br />
We all need reliable transportation, but the cost of new vehicle ownership can sometimes be too much to handle. Sites like <a href="http://craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> and <a href="http://nationalvehicle.com" target="_blank">NationalVehicle.com</a> have listings for thousands of pre-owned cars, trucks, RVs and motorcycles that can get you the transportation you need at extremely affordable prices. If you tastes go to the extreme, <a href="http://jamesedition.com" target="_blank">JamesEdition</a> has even compiled listings for pre-owned items like yachts, helicopters, Rolex watches and luxury cars.<br />
<strong><em>Buyer &#8211; and Seller &#8211; Beware</em></strong><br />
Ultimately, the items you can find on the sites listed above are great so long as you have a way to protect your finances during the transaction. Without the benefit of a financing company or dealership to package monthly payments, transactions for used items are usually a single lump sum payment. As these purchases often take place between two parties with little to no experience with one another &#8211; and are many time separated by a distance that requires involving a shipping company &#8211; <a title="PaySAFE Online Escrow" href="http://paysafeescrow.com" target="_blank">online escrow</a> can be of great benefit to both the buyer and seller. Buyers are protected knowing that their purchase funds will be held securely with a neutral third party until there is proof that the item has been shipped, or has even arrived for their inspection at the final destination. Sellers are protected as all purchase funds are verified in advance, eliminating the risk of fraudulent checks, insufficient funds or credit card charge backs.<br />
While these secondary markets can be amazing finds when it comes to saving time and money, it behooves any buyer or seller to learn the ropes before diving in head first. There are different requirements and practices for each marketplace, and taking the time to ask questions of customer service reps or seasoned users can be a huge help. More often than not there&#8217;s one old adage that can save even the most veteran online buyer or seller: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br />
