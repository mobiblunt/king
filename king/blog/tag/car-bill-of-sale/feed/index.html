Not only do most states require a bill of sale when buying or selling items like cars, motorcycles or firearms, the federal government will also require this for tax purposes. Forgetting a bill of sale can leave the previous owner in a pinch when tax time rolls around, and the buyer in an equally difficult situation when it comes to licensing and registration.<br />
<strong><em>What Needs to be on a Bill of Sale?</em></strong><br />
Bills of sale include a relatively simple and easy-to-find set of information. At a minimum, the document needs to include the names of both the buyer and seller, a description of the item being sold, date of the transaction, and the price at which it was purchased. For items like vehicles, boats, machinery, or firearms it&#8217;s also wise to include information like the VIN or serial number, make/model, and mileage or operating hours. PaySAFE actually provides a <a title="Free Bill of Sale" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/billofsale/wizard" target="_blank">free bill of sale</a> wizard that will allow you to create a basic bill of sale &#8211; at no cost to you &#8211; that compiles all the minimum information that most states ask for. However, we highly recommend contacting your local DMV to confirm and additional paperwork or documentation that may be required.<br />
<strong><em>I have my Bill of Sale&#8230; Now What?</em></strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve compiled all the information needed on your bill of sale, we recommend having a few copies for both parties to sign. This ensure that both you and the other party will have a copy with identical information, and signatures from each party as well. Depending on where you live you may also need the stamp of a notary for the bill of sale to be considered valid. Again, we recommend that youÂ consult with your local DMV or government office to ensure you have all the proper signatures lined up.<br />
Either party can draft up copies of a bill of sale, so even if the other party has offered to do so it&#8217;s never a bad idea to have a blank bill of sale or two of your own handy &#8211; just in case. Remember, whether or not the other party has said that they&#8217;ll put the proper paperwork together, in the eyes of the government it&#8217;s your responsibility to ensure that you have everything required to document and report your transaction.<br />

We&#8217;ve already discussed the <a title="The Importance of a Purchase Agreement" href="http://blog.paysafeescrow.com/2013/12/20/the-importance-of-a-purchase-agreement/" target="_blank">importance of a purchase agreement</a>, but a Bill of Sale is something a little different.<br />
<strong><em>What is a Bill of Sale Used for?</em></strong><br />
In its simplest form a Bill of Sale is simply a document that shows who sold an item, who purchased that item, and the dollar amount for which that item was purchased. For the seller, this paperwork is mostly ceremonial and is used primarily for record keeping to show that they no longer own the item in question. But for buyers, a Bill of Sale is much more important. In many states, new vehicle owners cannot complete insurance or registration/licensing forms without a Bill of Sale. These documents are also often used to determine any state or local taxes that buyers must pay in conjunction with their registration and licensing.<br />
<strong><em>What Do I Need to Include on a Bill of Sale?</em></strong><br />
While the required information on a Bill of Sale will vary slightly from state to state, all will include required information like the name and address of the buyer and seller, the sale amount of whatever was sold, and any registration, VIN or plate numbers specific to the item being sold. Additional information will vary depending on whether it was a car, boat, camper or motorcycle that was bought, but most state DMVs have instructions on their websites as to what details need to be included. You can also <a title="Free Bill of Sale from PaySAFE Escrow" href="https://paysafeescrow.com/billofsale/wizard" target="_blank">fill out a free bill of sale</a> on our site that includes a section for notary public stamping if it&#8217;s required in your state.<br />
<strong><em>Who&#8217;s Responsible for the Bill of Sale?</em></strong><br />
While either party can draft a Bill of Sale, it never hurts to come with a blank or partially completed form of your own in case the other party forgets &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re the buyer. You may even want to bring multiple copies so that each person can have two copies for their records. If you happen to be buying from a dealer, the dealership will draft up all the necessary paperwork for you.<br />
Again, paperwork and the details required on a Bill of Sale will vary slightly from state to state, so be sure to <a title="Find Your Local DMV" href="http://www.dmv.org/dmv-office-finder.php" target="_blank">consult your local DMV</a> to ensure that both parties are aware of what&#8217;s needed. If the requirements are in any way unclear, err on the side of gathering too much information from both parties. This can save you the time and hassle of trying to track down the buyer or seller after the sale is complete.</p>
