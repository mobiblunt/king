								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing it Yourself is a big trend in home remodeling but beware of your limitations; some projects may need to be done by a professional. <a href="http://www.moneytalksnews.com/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">MoneyTalksNews</span></a> offers advice on six things to consider when determining if your project is a do-it-yourself job or not.<br />
<strong>1. Does the project demand extensive knowledge or skill?</strong><br />
<strong>2. If I mess up, will it be noticeable?</strong><br />
<strong>3. Will I need special tools to complete the project?</strong><br />
<strong>4. Will the savings be worth not having it done professionally?</strong><br />
<strong>5. What would a professional recommend?</strong><br />
<strong>6. Am I putting myself in danger by DIY?</strong><br />
Hiring a contractor can save you time and money and piece of mind here are some tips from <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.angieslist.com/">Angie’s List</a> </span> for Making Hiring Decisions:<br />
• Call at least 3 contractors for estimates and check references, credit history and business standing.<br />
• Ask about licensing. Make sure the contractor is properly licensed for the job they will perform.<br />
• If your home was built before 1978, confirm that they are meet the EPA’s new lead paint certification requirements.<br />
• Get estimates in writing. Documentation is often the best ammunition you have if things go wrong.<br />
• Beware contractors who give you only a PO Box or answering service as contact.<br />
• Clearly communicate the updates/repairs you want done. A rough idea on paper is better than nothing.<br />
After you choose your contractor make sure and use <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/contractor-escrow">PaySAFE</a> escrow services to draw up your plans and contract agreement. <a href="https://paysafeescrow.com/contractor-escrow">PaySAFE</a>  makes home improvement projects stress free by providing financial protection and better communication between contractor and home owner.  Benefits for all parties include:<br />
<strong>As a Homeowner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NEVER prepay an unknown Contractor before he has done any work!</li>
<li>Confidence that the project is completed to your satisfaction before the Contractor gets paid</li>
<li>Ability to access PaySAFE online 24/7 to view progress photos and plans</li>
<li style="display:inline!important;"></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>As a Contractor</strong>
<ul>
<li>Receive financial commitment upfront so you do not have to worry about invoicing, past due payments, NSF checks or Bad debt</li>
<li>Ability to request partial payments as the project hit milestones allowing you to make payable on time</li>
<li>Demonstrate your Integrity to complete the job successfully</li>
<li>All communication through the site is tracked as a part of the communication history for disputes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
