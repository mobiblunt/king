					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I would ever buy a car without seeing it in person first. Thank you for these tips, though! If I ever do need to get one online, I will make sure to check shipping prices and for the right documentation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like your point on making sure to read the fine print before bidding on the piece of machinery.  Like you said it&#039;s important to make sure that everything looks right on the equipment.  In fact, I think it might be a good idea to make sure that you get a list of any parts that were replaced so that you can also check their individual quality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you- unless you are planning on doing consistent renovations, it is better to rent your equipment then buy it. I also thing that buying used machinery can be a good option, but at the same time you risk spending money on faulty equipment. In my experience, renting the equipment is the better option.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of renting a little more since you mentioned that the insurance and maintenance are covered by the owner of the machine. I work for a small company that doesn&#039;t have a lot of room in the budget for ongoing costs like insuring more equipment than we already have. We&#039;ll have to keep this in mind so we aren&#039;t paying more than we need to for our projects!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the article! I thought it was interesting that you suggest taking good care of your equipment to ensure a good resale value. Having a machine that can continue to do its job is a good investment if taken care of properly. I can see the wisdom behind trying to make sure each piece of equipment gets its share of good care. I really appreciate you input. I hope to apply these tips in my own work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is some really great information for anyone planning on buying a used car. Having a vehicle inspected is a really important step that all too often people neglect, especially if you&#039;re buying from an individual rather than a dealer. It&#039;s true that most people selling their cars are trustworthy, but a few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch, so it&#039;s a necessary and valuable step in the process. Thanks so much for writing!]]></description>
